The pain has been gradually decreasing but its still there. Stretching helps a bit but too much and I start feeling tight chested. I think maybe I pinched an artery or a nerve got damaged. What do you guys think it is?",0.054,0.156,0.79

The part that is obstructing my vision is not an actual blur but more like a pixelated-censor (imagine a reality tv show censoring out something obscene).

I have gone through every possible cause by my doctor - DP/DR, anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, Autism, silent migraines, iron or b12 deficiency. But nothing seems to be the perfect explanation as i’m unable to describe my symptoms. i have self diagnosed myself with HPPD as it seems the most logical but i lack all other visual traits except this 2D, cartoonish looking perspective.

It can go from 25% strength to 80%, worsens with caffeine, lack of sleep etc. I used to have really bad anxiety and panic attacks as i thought i was going crazy but escitalopram controls that.

psychology,Is It Harmful or Helpful? Examining the causes and consequences of generative AI usage among university students - International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education,"From Discussion:

“The recent emergence of generative AI has brought about significant implications for various societal institutions, including higher education institutions. As a result, there has been a notable upswing in discussions among scholars and academicians regarding the transformative potential of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, in higher education and the risks associated with it (Dalalah & Dalalah, 2023; Meyer et al., 2023; Peters et al., 2023; Yilmaz & Yilmaz, 2023a). 

Specifically, the dynamics of ChatGPT are still unknown in the context that no study, to date, has yet provided any empirical evidence on why students’ use ChatGPT. The literature is also silent on the potential consequences, harmful or beneficial, of ChatGPT usage (Dalalah & Dalalah, 2023; Paul et al., 2023) despite a ban in many institutions across the globe. Responding to these gaps in the literature, the current study proposed workload, time pressure, sensitivity to rewards, and sensitivity to quality as the potential determinants of the use of ChatGPT. In addition, the study examined the effects of ChatGPT usage on students’ procrastination, memory loss, and academic performance.”",0.074,0.042,0.884

psychology,Borderline personality disorder symptoms linked to music preferences,">Individuals with varying degrees of borderline personality disorder symptoms exhibit distinct music preferences, according to new research published in Psychology of Music. The findings shed light on how the psychological functions attributed to music can influence musical tastes.

Borderline personality disorder is a mental health condition characterized by a pattern of ongoing instability in moods, behavior, self-image, and functioning. These experiences often result in impulsive actions and unstable relationships with others.

The rationale for exploring the relationship between borderline personality disorder and music preferences stems from the recognition of music’s significant role in human life, particularly its therapeutic potential. Music can profoundly affect emotions, mood, and social connections. It offers a unique window into an individual’s psychological state and coping mechanisms.

Given that individuals with borderline personality disorder experience intense emotions and instability, understanding their music preferences could provide insights into how they use music for emotional regulation, identity formation, and social interaction.

The study analyzed data from 549 participants, divided based on their scores on an abbreviated version of the Borderline Personality Inventory. The division created two groups: one with low scores (indicating low symptom severity of borderline personality disorder) and another with high scores (indicating higher symptom severity). The sample predominantly consisted of females (75.6%), reflecting the demographic trends observed in borderline personality disorder populations.

Music preferences were gauged using the Short Test of Music Preferences (STOMP), which measures individuals’ likes and dislikes across 14 different music genres, reflecting a wide range of musical tastes. The researchers employed another scale to measure the psychological functions attributed to music. This scale includes items related to self-awareness, social connectivity, and emotional and arousal regulation, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the reasons participants might turn to music.

The researchers found that participants with higher borderline personality symptom severity exhibited distinct preferences for certain types of music. Notably, individuals exhibiting higher symptom severity showed a preference for reflective and complex music genres, such as classical or jazz, while showing less interest in intense and rebellious genres like heavy metal or punk.

The severity of borderline personality disorder symptoms was also significantly related to how individuals perceived the functions of music. Specifically, it was found that the more severe the borderline symptoms, the less individuals valued music for its capacity to foster self-awareness and social bonds.

The researchers also examined how the psychological functions of music serve as mediators in the relationship between borderline symptoms and music preferences. They found that these functions partially explain why individuals with higher borderline personality symptom severity favor or disfavor certain music genres.

Specifically, the study suggests that the diminished value placed on music for self-awareness and social relatedness among those with higher borderline symptoms leads to a decreased preference for intense and rebellious music.",0.066,0.071,0.863

psychology,"Even the Stars Think That I am Superior: Personality, intelligence and belief in astrology","Abstract: 

“Belief in astrology is on the rise, although the reasons behind this are unclear. We tested whether individual personality traits could predict such epistemically unfounded beliefs. Data was collected for 264 participants through an anonymous online survey shared on social media. The survey consisted of four instruments: Belief in Astrology (BAI), the Big Five personality traits (IPIP-30), narcissism (SD3) and intelligence (ICAR16-R3D). Data analysis was done with multiple linear regression. Narcissism was surprisingly the strongest predictor, and intelligence showed a negative relationship with belief in astrology. Overall, our novel results suggest that something as innocent as astrology could both attract and possibly reinforce individual differences.”

Excerpt from Discussion:

“The main result showed that the higher the narcissism, perhaps surprisingly, the higher the belief in astrology. The positive association is possibly due to the self-centred worldview uniting them, though this must be examined in further research. Furthermore, cultural aspects of millennials may emphasize the uniqueness of individuals which might lead to a more egocentric view of the world, and thus relate to narcissistic traits. Further, since astrological predictions and horoscopes tend to be positively framed, this reinforces grandiose feelings and thus might appeal even more to narcissists. Note that narcissistic traits correlated with the belief that astrology is supported by science (Table 1), which leads to a speculation that narcissists may generally be more fact resistant.”


Limitations:

“As with most survey designs, social desirability bias, common method bias, and the use of self-report may be an issue. Another limitation was that we had no control over who participated in the study, thus introducing a potential selection bias. In the same vein, we do not know how much participants know about astrology. Also, since the vast majority were younger women recruited through social media the sample is not generalisable to a broader population.”",0.114,0.042,0.844

psychology,The Role of Emotion in Conscious Experience from a Metaphysical Perspective.,"I have also included a link to some studies that illustrate the relationship between emotion and perception. 

I will also start by saying that this is merely a hypothesis and should be considered as pre-empirical. 

Galileo once said something along the lines of “it is the role of the bible to tell us how to get into heaven, not what heaven is.” This quote marks the beginning of modern scientific theory and was also espoused largely by Sir Francis Bacon. The main distinction that separates induction (empiricism) from rationalism is the notion that it is the role of the bible to determine morality, while it is the role of science to find out what things are. This came from a distinction that humans were separate from nature, and that we also have dominion over it (the book of Genesis).

 Because we are unique, we are able to determine how the world works, but also how we differentiate ourselves from animals. This led to the belief that humans, in their unique capacity to rationalize, and to communicate through complex language, that humans are capable of being objective observers of our environment in the sense that empiricism can provide 99.9% certainty on aspects of our world. Much psychological research focuses on how we are unique, and what makes us the “apex” predator, and our justification for why we are the way we are is our cognition.

However, ecology and philosophy have since shown that we are basically incapable of objective assessment through cognition, as we are simply the products of our environment. Our ancestors make ourselves up, but everyone else around us malleates that being into who we are. Additionally, we are slaves to our perception, and our sensory interpretation of a thing is only ever a representation of that thing rather than the thing in itself. This implies that although our instruments can get us to 99.9% validity, we are never capable of true objectivity. Psychology has unfortunately been behind in catching up with this idea from a metaphysical basis, and much research has been done on rationality, cognition, and how we are able to “objectively” interpret our world through logic, while not much has been done in terms of our understanding of emotion.

That being said, research in developmental psychology is starting to bring up this question, and trauma research is making it clear that emotion may play a much bigger role than we currently give it credit for.

What is clear is that there has been a focus on what makes us unique specifically because scientific theory is based on a Christian metaphysical idea which tells us that we are separate from our environment. If we are to understand how the brain works, however, it is more important to consider what makes us similar to all the other beings that evolved alongside us over time, rather than what makes us unique.

 I hypothesize that the root of our cognitive functioning should also exist in mammals, as we have evolved from the same conditions, and that regardless of an animal’s cognitive capacities, those animals still have an external and internal experience of self (this cannot be proven empirically as we will never experience in the conscious experience of an animal, however, if you watch a dogs behavior for five minutes you can understand the complexity of that animal on a subjective level).

So, what is the thing that is universal among most mobile creatures? That would be an emotional experience. An animal may be acting on “instincts,” (a concept that has been compared to reflex, but could better be understood conceptually as fear), but we also act on these tendencies. We know that cognition affects our emotional experience, but we also know our emotions have great impacts on our conscious experience, yet the focus has been on cognition specifically thus far.

A study will be done that correlates illogical thinking with depressive symptoms, and the psychologist will make the inference that illogical thinking causes emotional distress. Yet we also know through psychological research that your emotions can affect your ability to think rationally, yet research has mainly focused on the former.

              What I propose is that to truly achieve a robust understanding of how the brain works, we must also consider what makes us similar to the creatures we share this earth with, which lies in emotional experience. I will make it clear that my definition of emotional experience is broad in the sense that is also contains unconscious experience, an example of this is that a cat will be “scared” of a cucumber (thinking it resembles a snake) without ever having seen a snake or been given a word for snake.

Cognition and emotion are intrinsically entwined, yet we still consider them as separate entities. I think cognition is better understood as our analysis of environment and emotion, and that it is a supplement of emotional experience rather than THE dominant force in the brain, although it also has the power to completely alter emotions in its analysis, appraisal, and rationalization.

What is increasingly clear through research however is that it also goes the other way, and emotions greatly affect perception, which in turn alters cognitive approaches to reality. An example of this is depression, as although you can tell someone over and over again that their hopelessness is illogical, unless they believe it for themselves on an emotional level, it will not be perceived as an objective fact of reality for that individual. This is why CBT is sometimes ineffective, as if cognition is unable to rationalize feelings, we end up slaves to those feelings.

              Most psychological disorders are fundamentally emotional problems which are complemented by cognitive experience. It cannot be said that emotion and cognition are separate entities as they influence each other so heavily, and merely focusing on the objective reality of what it means to be human is to ignore the inherent subjectivity of what it is to be a human in this world. Two people can be given the exact same facts, and form polar opposite political opinions, which are often formed by those persons previous cognitive and emotional experiences, which are also affected by each other.

If we are truly to understand the brain, we must focus on what makes us similar to everything else rather than what makes us unique, and more research must be done in the realm of emotion in order to understand consciousness and human psychology on a more robust level. It is awesome that we are able to know what a synapse is, but is our ability to do math, or to be certain about things what really makes life worth living? To me, and many other humans, they are all means to an end, which is ultimately to be content in one’s own existence. Or in other words, to be content with one’s own emotional experience, which is the goal of abnormal psychology to begin with.",0.085,0.037,0.878

psychology,"The Schizophrenia Syndrome, circa 2024: What we know and how that informs its nature.","Abstract:

>With new data about different aspects of schizophrenia being continually generated, it becomes necessary to periodically revisit exactly what we know. Along with a need to review what we currently know about schizophrenia, there is an equal imperative to evaluate the construct itself. With these objectives, we undertook an iterative, multi-phase process involving fifty international experts in the field, with each step building on learnings from the prior one. This review assembles currently established findings about schizophrenia (construct, etiology, pathophysiology, clinical expression, treatment) and posits what they reveal about its nature. Schizophrenia is a heritable, complex, multi-dimensional syndrome with varying degrees of psychotic, negative, cognitive, mood, and motor manifestations. The illness exhibits a remitting and relapsing course, with varying degrees of recovery among affected individuals with most experiencing significant social and functional impairment. 

>Genetic risk factors likely include thousands of common genetic variants that each have a small impact on an individual's risk and a plethora of rare gene variants that have a larger individual impact on risk. Their biological effects are concentrated in the brain and many of the same variants also increase the risk of other psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder, autism, and other neurodevelopmental conditions. 

>Environmental risk factors include but are not limited to urban residence in childhood, migration, older paternal age at birth, cannabis use, childhood trauma, antenatal maternal infection, and perinatal hypoxia. Structural, functional, and neurochemical brain alterations implicate multiple regions and functional circuits. Dopamine D-2 receptor antagonists and partial agonists improve psychotic symptoms and reduce risk of relapse. Certain psychological and psychosocial interventions are beneficial. Early intervention can reduce treatment delay and improve outcomes. 

>Schizophrenia is increasingly considered to be a heterogeneous syndrome and not a singular disease entity. There is no necessary or sufficient etiology, pathology, set of clinical features, or treatment that fully circumscribes this syndrome. A single, common pathophysiological pathway appears unlikely. The boundaries of schizophrenia remain fuzzy, suggesting the absence of a categorical fit and need to reconceptualize it as a broader, multi-dimensional and/or spectrum construct.",0.061,0.083,0.857

psychology,Why were Covid denier’s obsessed with talking about “the agenda”?,"A few friends of mine were constantly complaining about Covid. That’s all they could focus on. Especially during the pandemic, they complained about the agenda the government had to depopulate America. These people were so focused on it, that they went out to buy trucks, trailers, end-of-the-war gear,  some were even going to jump ship. Quitting their jobs, cashing out their 401k and planning to life off grid. From an outsider looking in these QAnon type of people displayed full on paranoia and delusion. What are your thoughts on these people?",0.059,0.079,0.862
depression,"I do everything to improve in life. I do my best to make myself happy. I overcame so much but no matter what I do, I end up in the same place as before.","I just turned 30. 

I have been working at Trader Joe's for 3 years. At first I really liked it. I think I still do but today I am having a bad day.

I pay my own rent and live in an apartment. 

I go to the gym 4-5 times a week. My brother's friend told me I look as great as I ever did. 

Yet, I struggle to make friends. The last time I had a girlfriend was before the pandemic. She was moving and we didn't want to do long distance but we are still friends. I am wondering what I am doing with my life and at the same time I don't want a career because no career interests me. 

There are a lot of younger co workers I have who love drama. And I feel like I have to avoid it at all costs. Cliques and whatnot. I try to stay with the co workers I vibe with. 

Sometimes I really connect with some of the female CO workers. But it's all at work. And I am afraid to ask if we should hang out outside of work because of boundaries. 

I want to find a hobby outside of work. I just can't decide. Ju kit su, rock climbing, dancing, or yoga are things I am interested in I just never get around to it for some reason. 

I don't know. I try so hard in life and I feel defeated.

depression,Destructive binge-procrastination lasting several days,"I've had this problem for a while and it's kind of been the main bane of my life. Was wondering if anyone else experienced something similar because so far had no luck finding anyone to relate to

 If I experience too much stress it might kick off a procrastination binge (usually consisting of watching YouTube or/and playing video games) while I neglect everything else in my life except most basic needs. I feel a lot of guilt in the process which feeds the vicious cycle - the guiltier I feel the more unpleasant it is to face that feeling so I procrastinate even more.

It used to happen to me quite often prior to being medicated but now it rarely occurs and is less severe. Still, it's really horrible when it does happen. One time i started watching youtube in the morning and kept on watching non stop for more than 24 hours, fell asleep, woke up and repeated the same process the next day too, to give you an idea. My eyes were glued to the phone screen the entire time.

Don't get any joy out of the process obviously just self-hatred.  It's also really hard to switch back to my regular operating mode after this happens and it usually takes me a whole day to slowly readjust.  

When I started getting medicated they diagnosed me with anxiety and depression and I also personally used to think there was an ocd element to it. Just recently after many years I found out I'm also on the lower end of the autism spectrum and also had adhd by finally getting diagnosed by a competent psychiatrist. 

Obviously I have a pretty bad case of whatever this is but perhaps someone can somewhat relate? Currently in the middle of such an episode

depression,Everything seems so calm now that I’ve made my decision ,"I have a plan. Well most of one. Just have to figure out where. Probably the beach. Sit on a bench and stare at the water. I thought about doing it in my car but I want my fiancée to be able to have it. 

My suffering never ends. Pain wracks my body 24/7. I have no job, no home, still live with my parents. Nothing in my life is how I want it. I don’t wanna be engaged. I don’t wanna live at my parents. I don’t wanna have back problems and pain for the rest of my life. I don’t wanna live. 

What is there to live for? An unstable future? Never owning a home. Never getting relief from this pain. What does it even matter. Everyone always says it’ll get better. It’ll be ok. Till it’s not. 

We all die. Our time on this earth is short. In my experience it is chock full of pain, suffering, regret, trauma, with small stars of happiness dotting the darkness. 

But I’ve decided to bow out. No more pain and suffering for me. I know it will hurt my family and friends, but I hurt too. In my heart, body and soul, I hurt. 

So now I have a sense of peace that I haven’t felt in a long time. Finally I’m in control. Finally I have hope. ",0.144,0.242,0.614

depression,Baby birds died in my care,"I’ve suffered from depression for a long time, my mom brought in two baby birds and the birds died in my care because I didn’t know what to do and couldn’t handle it because I battling my own battles and had to sleep due to depression. The birds died either from starvation or sickness and I had to let them go into a bush where one is dying and the other is watching over the other. My mom makes it my responsibility and then I had to live with the guilt whenever something bad happens to them. Apparently you’re supposed to leave the birds out in nature and not touch them and she didn’t listen to did it anyway. Now the birds are dead, I’m the only one who feels guilty and depressed over it and I just broke a few things out of my house after finally screaming at my mom to never fucking pickup animals again and its not my responsibility anymore. She always makes me the one to take care of it and its my job to make sure they’re safe when I can’t even feed myself or shower most days. Now I’m filled with guilt and sadness that I couldn’t do anything and I’m suicidal again. 


Edit: I said died but one is dying and the other is close and I can’t bare to go back and try to save them. I can’t do it and I don’t know how to I can’t do this I didn’t fucking ask for this and now I have to fucking live with the guilt while my fucking mom doesn’t give a shit",0.048,0.164,0.788

depression,It sucks how I get treated over things I can't even control.,"I'm 17 and all my life i've been ugly. What makes it worse is the fact that both my parents are good looking. Growing up I would always get outcasted and when I would try to fit in i'd just get ignored or made fun of. Occasionally i'd get picked on physically and when I tried to defend myself it was me getting in trouble. When the pandemic hit I realized just how lonely I really was, no text no calls, no nothing from the few people I considered friends and I simply stopped trying to make talk with anyone. My parents thought it was my fault for not having friends because of the way I behaved but thing is you can't expect someone who's been treated poorly their whole life to be a good person. This year I genuinely wanted to improve myself, I started dressing better, taking care of myself being more social and kind but guess what, I still get treated badly by everyone. It's all because of the way that I look and I can't change that, at least not yet. And please don't give me that ""beauty is subjective/on the inside"" bullshit, you'll never see a good looking person getting picked on or having a hard time socializing.

depression,Husband (38) won’t go on antidepressants. Need advice. ,"Forgive the long post, we’re out of answers and need advice. 

My husband (38) and I (32) have been together for 9 years, married for 2. He has battled depression since he was ~12 years old and has expressed to me over the years we’ve been together that he’s always has always had some level of suicidal thoughts but has never acted on it. 

Over the last 8 months he’s been in an extremely dark place. He had to leave a job that he loved and ended up getting another one that totally broke him (toxic boss and work environment) until he quit. The last 4 months has been full of panic attacks, severe depression and mentions of suicide (but never “how”). He tried medication for one week, but didn’t like that it made him tired and have no energy, so he threw away the pills. He’s been going to therapy for about 8 years, and has seen a psychiatrist that believes he has bipolar II. 

He keeps saying he’s scared, and that it’s unfair to me that he can’t be happy. He’s severely depressed, can hardly get out of bed, cries almost everyday. He’s mentioned not wanting to live/not wanting to be here more frequently. 

I’m in no way considering leaving him, I love him endlessly, but I need him to consider medication. He’ll take a Xanax when it’s really bad but it knocks him out only to wake up to the same feelings. He keeps saying he doesn’t know what to do, that he can’t live like this but also refuses to try meds again.

depression,the disgusting urge to get worse,"tw: self harm, suicide mentions, yada yada.

I don’t know why I feel this way but I just wanna get worse, I wanna continue to hurt myself and break myself till I eventually give in and actually kill myself.

I don’t wanna die, I tell myself that constantly — and I do believe that that’s true, but whenever someone comments on me ‘feeling better’ or that things are just going better I just feel this sick, disgusting and overwhelming urge to get worse.

I fucking hate it, I feel at conflict with myself — I wanna get better and actually have a shot at life and at the same time I wanna cut my skin to shreds and cry myself to sleep.

I went on a walk and my dad commented on how I seem like I’ve been better recently and that things are looking up, and I got this conflicted feeling of if I should go home and hurt myself or if I should try and actually tackle some shit I’m struggling with.

I’ve got this pile of clothes on my bedroom floor, it keeps getting larger and larger every day and once it’s there it’s difficult to actually put away the clothes — so I decided since ‘I’m better’ I’m gonna try to remove the clothes.

I managed to fold 10 pieces of clothing in an 50 minute span.

10.

I felt like an absolute failure and I laid on the floor crying and when my dad walked in he didn’t even give a shit, just acted like he didn’t see me and then left.

so now I’m on the bathroom floor, crying like a pathetic child with new cuts all over my legs because i wanna get worse.

I can't tell how much of this is true, but it genuinely seems like I won't be able to financially support myself on my own even without my mental illnesses. I have ptsd, severe anxiety, and depression and I hate to admit it but I shower like at most once a week at least once every two weeks, I mainly eat poptarts, white cheddar popcorn, and whatever my parents make for dinner, and other unhealthy stuff. I keep my room relatively clean but I can't sort my laundry, I can't get myself to work out or learn to cook, and I'm avoiding college. I can't stand to go to school anymore and I don't get why we're graduating now just to do the same fucking thing in four years. School was absolute fucking hell even though I have friends and good grades. I can't get 8 hours of sleep, I can't get myself into any new consistent schedules, and therapy isn't working. I've been in therapy for over five years with multiple different ones and CBT is bullshit. I've tried other things and I'm trying to get EMDR but nothing I do fucking works.

If you look at my post and comment history here you'll see I'm an incredibly embittered person. It's not always my intention to be a troll, but I use this platform as a way to let go a portion of the frustration that afflicts and invades my existence.

I'm a 28 year old guy with cerebral palsy and bipolar disorder. My entire life has been spent being the ""weird"" one, ""different,"" and generally otherized. The bitterness on Reddit has its source in real life. Growing up I got expelled from five schools. This means one expulsion every two years until 9th grade. They were ALL due to my terrible behavior, again borne out of my anger towards the world.

Things really started to go south for me after high school when starting college in 2014. I never graduated before dropping out. During the course of my university life I started to get depressed. Each depressive episode being worse than the previous. This reached critical mass in 2018 when I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a disastrous manic episode that also led to my having to file for bankruptcy. After that I felt, for the first time, that my life was ruined. Eventually, depression and the start of the COVID pandemic made me drop out. Then, my grandparents, whom I was living with kicked me out in 2022. I stayed with my dad for a few months until he decided to move in order to kick me out.

I moved out in late 2022. I had over 20K in savings that eventually dried up. I had a full-time job for a time but had to quit because my body couldn't take being in an office environment for nine hours a day every day. When I quit in April of last year I started a relatively profitable freelance business but I never seem to be well enough to take advantage of my skills and maximize them for profit.

In February I completely ran out of money and tried to end myself. Sadly, I survived. My family has promised to pay the 20K of debt I accumulated (not the same 20K in savings) but I still haven't accomplished anything. I don't have anything. I can't get anywhere and I'm too disabled and too crazy to keep trying.

depression,Why do I feel like people don't care about me as much I care about them?,"First of all, sorry for my broken english. This post will be a long one, but I really need to vent and I feel like this is a safe place to do so. 

  
Anyways, for my whole life I struggled with the thought that my friends (especially my two besties, which I've known for 20 and 11 years respectively) secretly cannot tollerate me, that they do not, in fact, love me, and are my friends just for pity. I think that it's also related to my low self-esteem. I'm already working on this with my psychologist and came to the conclusion that it's just my mind perceiving this, especially because I was proven wrong on multiple occasions: they DO love me. 

  
This is it, until recently. I feel like they DO care about me, but at the same time not as much a before, and not as much as I care about them. (From now on, I am talking about my two besties)

Little exemples: 

- them not inviting me at gathering even though it's a weekend day, which means there's a 80% chance of me having free time. Just today, they went to a convention and didn't even ask or tell me at all. It's not like they cannot have fun and go of course, but I would have loved to be taken into consideration. Also, they are not sending me messages or memes as much as before, and when I do write to them the conversation dies shortly.

- we always had this ""tradition"" of celebrating new year's eve together. Which we always did in the last few years. Last 30th december, though, I had no news from them, but it was pretty common since we do something small and leave nearby, so we need no organization. I spent Christmas holidays with my family (they live 5 hours from my current home) but came back on December 30th for the New Year celebration. I asked my friends about it and they told me that they were too tired and didn't think about celebrating this year. End of the story is me celebrating new year's eve alone because everybody else was busy and it was too late to take a train back to my parents. I told to my friends that that really hurt me, and even though they apologized they also ""accused"" me that I asked too late. Which is true, but that made me feel completely at fault, being the hurt one. 

I feel like they might care about me, but at the same time they are taking me a little too much for granted. Like ""she'll be there when we need, no risks to losing her"". Problem is I'm getting tired of this treatment, and I already trying to emotionally detach myself and don't get too many expectations from them, otherwise it hurts too much. 

I am sure I must doing something wrong, that this is not entirely their fault. I know for sure that I have considerably less time to spend time with them, as I work a 9-7 shift in the week days and it's a mentally draining job. And I felt like they were a bit bored when I always complained about my job, that's why I completely stopped doing so because I didn't want to bother them. 

I have my fault in this, I'm not completely innocent, and I sincerely hope this is just in my head, but there is no doubt that I'm hurt from this situation.

I have not celebrated my last 7 birthdays since I moved abroad. Nobody wishes me on the day except mum and dad. Nobody cares.

I don't have a house or a car (live in flatshare).

I don't have anything to show for the life I have lived so far.

It's not about loneliness or lack of material achievements necessarily. For me it's more like a defeaning sense of defeat. That I am not worth anyone's time.

I honestly don't know why I am here. What's the purpose of my existence. Like go to work come home eat food sleep and go to work again and deal with shi**y ppl there. 

Can you help me see any semblance of objective self worth in me? Because I can't see it in myself.

Thanks.",0.116,0.098,0.786

depression,I can't stop harming myself ,"

I remember last month when i first cut my arms, my mother with her yelling and threats made my life with her a living nightmare. It didn't become better at work as my anxiety was as its worst. What if these people are laughing at me? What if i never had a family like those? What if i died alone? My anxiety made sure that every little mistakes made me feel like a failure. So i went to the shop and bought a razor blade pack under the excuse that i need it to my hair. I carried it at work and when's work became stressful, i sliced my arm. I still remember my reaction. Pained, Nauseous, Disgusted. I said to myself that ill never do that again to myself.

But i kept slicing and slicing. From work to school bathrooms. Over and over again. If i didn't feel the pain, i would go a bit deeper or slice in another direction just to feel something. To have some excitement in life. Only one person noticed my scars. I was sitting with him and he was mocking me when he noticed the scars. He was about to ask me about the scars but his friend cut him off. Now yesterday, i wrote how i wanted to cut my arms off till I'm happy. Turns out that my boss read it and told only my step father.  I was expecting him to support me and ask me about my mental health but he started ranting about how i was lazy and implied that i was purposefully trying to make everyone feel bad for me. Now i just bought a pack again and I'll update you what I'll do.

Edit: I did cut myself in the bathroom again. Also don’t try to encourage me to stop. There’s no hope for me ",0.116,0.152,0.732
depression,"I simply don't have any expectations, dreams or any strong emotions to continue.","First of all, english is not my first language, so excuse me if i make any mistakes.
I am 19(F), which i know i am not old and it is probably normal not to experince things, but since i aged, i started to feel like i am missing things in life. I can say that  there is not anything i experienced bad or good. For example, i have a family, not perfect of course but i feel like  i do not have any rights to complain since i know there are really awful people out there. Moreover, i have friends which i really care about, and most importantly i don't have any doubts about their love towards me. I would like to have more friends maybe, but i am introverted so it is really hard for me to go out and meet people. Even if i go out, I have been told i look intimitated, so this could be one of the reasons why i don't get approached often. To clarify, i don't think i am unloveable and i am not afraid to not being loved. It is actually the opposite actually. I am the one who doesn't feel anything towards anyone. In romantic way, i can say that, i never had a boyfriend but the reason was not that they did not like me or something. I could have get one if i wanted(liked them). However, i felt nothing towards people who approached me in that way, or i felt something to someone even though they did not like me that way. So i believe i did the right thing by rejecting their affection.
It seems like i am asexual but i really don't think i am one. To be honest, i do want to be with someone that i like. But i feel like i am not capable of liking anyone. In other relationships which are not romantic, i care for people who are in my life of course, but is it really enough? If i don't see some of my friends for a really long time, i would not even miss them i think. I care about them really, and i know i would feel good when i see them after a long time. But  between that, i don't think i would miss them. It is same for my family too. This situation got me thinking about  ""missing"", and i realized i have never missed someone in my whole life, i even had to ask someone what missing someone feels like to understand if i ever felt something like that. I started to think i am lacking in emotions. 
I am a collage student and my major is not something i like, i only picked this major because it was the best one i could get with my exam results, which my university and my major can be really considered a good one. However, i am thinking of quitting since it is really hard one and it has already destroyed my mental state,and absolutely no need for more of that, so it is really not worth to study since i do not even like it, and don't get me wrong, i may have some masochist treats, but i am mostly self-destructive, and i always felt like no one or nothing can hurt me like the way i hurt myself. In short, i am changing majors, but another problem starts from here. I don't know what i want to do, i never had any dreams of becoming something. I don't have any passion for something either. To be honest, staying where i am is easier than doing an important change in my life, and this even got me thinking of dying which it would be the best choice since i don't have any dreams, or desire to live, and etc. . 
I think i still would not take any action towards that, but i think about this quite often, and it makes sense in some ways. I don't have any expectations from life,( i guess i would like to love someone with my whole heart but i do not see it is happening), and dreams or future plans either. At this point, i only live because i am breathing? I know i should appreciate the things i have, but i literally can't, i just can't fake these things. I can lie to people or simply i don't talk about this things in my life, but  feelings can not be forged. 
If there was a button which would delete my whole existence, i would not even think but press it. And i know i am not the only one who would do that, this thing is really common in my generation, but i see people with their heart broken after really bad experience; hovewer, i am not one of them i think, so is there someone like me? If there was, how do you cope with this?

depression,I think my ADHD masked anxiety/depression.,"**TW: Discussion of depression, feelings of worthlessness, anxiety, suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self harm. Please don't read if this may be triggering for you, take care of yourself <3.**

Hey all. I'm just having a hard day today and I just need to get some thoughts out and reflect, so I can maybe find the confidence and the words to talk about it with my ADHD coach haha.

I was diagnosed with ADHD in between my first and second years of uni. Since I've gotten diagnosed, many aspects of my life *have* improved. My grades went way up because I got accommodations, medication, and coaching. I actually manage to clean and meal prep for the week, and my apartment is not a total and complete mess. I make appointments and keep them, and manage to actually implement systems to keep track of all I have to do. My ADHD has never been better managed, and I'm still working with a coach to keep improving the way I deal with it.

At the same time, I don't think I've *ever* felt as low and empty and anxious as I do now. In all fairness, I did just go through a *harrowing* academic year doing a capstone project in a lab with a very toxic work environment, which has undoubtedly affected my mental health. Part of me wants to explain it away as just that. But it feels deeper.

When I got diagnosed, for a while things were amazing. I felt like there was finally a reason for everything I struggled with, and everything was getting better so quickly that I just felt so accomplished. But then this emptiness, that I think maybe has always been there, has just crept up on me. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I went on a vacation with my partner and it was just *fine* instead of being the amazing time I had hoped and expected it would be. Getting out of bed is hard. Talking to others has been so difficult- I just can't find the energy to keep in touch with people and I feel horrible because it's making me lose touch with people I care about. I feel constantly anxious about so many things socially, about my job, about school, about my partner, about my in-laws, about my friends, about my family- I can't remember the last time that I went into a social situation without a huge pit in my stomach.

I feel like I'm constantly just going through motions, and I can't stop because I'll just fall apart if I do. Like work and school keep me busy enough to not think about how I'm feeling and give me something to blame my fatigue and low moods on. And simultaneously, I feel like I'm faking all of these bad feelings, because on the outside I don't think anyone would say I'm depressed. I am still achieving high grades, moving forward in my career and securing research positions, I still do my hobbies and I put on a happy face for everyone. I go to the gym and yoga religiously and eat healthy and do all these things that are ""good"" for you but I don't feel any better. On the inside, everyday is a huge struggle. Everyday, I feel like everyone around me would be better off if I didn't exist. I have this huge urge to buy a plane ticket to the other side of the country and run away. I feel disconnected from everyone I care about, and like I'm in this huge hole I'll never crawl out of.

And on top of it all, whereas I saw my ADHD as a part of me that I had to work with when I got diagnosed, I increasingly feel stupid, worthless, and like a burden and a failure when my symptoms start getting the best of me. When I can't focus, my inner monologue has shifted from, ""it's okay, this is your ADHD, take a breather and try again/switch tasks/etc"", to, ""you're a worthless stupid failure who will never achieve anything, everyone you love is disappointed in you, and you deserve to hurt"". I feel horrible for backsliding in terms of my acceptance of my ADHD.

I'm just so tired. Everything is exhausting and I feel constantly overstimulated. My sensory issues have gotten worse lately too. It's all putting a strain on my relationship, because I don't feel as emotionally intimate with my partner.

It feels like now that I'm not struggling as much to simply organize my thoughts due to my ADHD, all of the perfectionism and self-hatred that I used to cope with my ADHD has run RAMPANT. Now that I can achieve what I thought I should be achieving before, I should be achieving *more*. I feel like I'm faking my achievements because I'm doing it with accommodations and help. I feel like I can't devote the time I want to every part of my life.

Life is hard. This sucks. I think I need to talk to my ADHD coach and tell her about these feelings, and maybe get back to proper therapy for these issues (I previously went to therapy to cope with some childhood trauma) and look into maybe medication. At the same time, I struggle to bring it up and be honest about it... To her, and to anyone. I feel like a burden whenever I take up space with my feelings, because I've been a mess so much of my life- I paid $4k for my ADHD assessment and any question about anxiety or depression I was just like, ""who me??? I would never! I've never had a negative thought or feeling in my life!"". And that makes me feel completely isolated.

I don't know how to ask for help, even though I know I need it. It feels like I should be solving these problems all on my own. But my method of avoidance clearly ain't working.

Anyways, if you took the time to read all of this, thank you. I hope it's relatable for someone. This is a rough spot, but I think there might be a breakthrough on the horizon that helps me get through it. We'll see I guess.",0.139,0.155,0.706

depression,"16M, no friends and disfunctional family","Hi reddit, im gonna write this in word and then hopefully paste it to some subreddits i can post with a throwaway (dont know which subs allow posting on completely new accounts)  
  
I know most of this wont sound like a complete tragedy but this shit has been in my head all my life and its all I know. Makes me feel like shit and not do anything literally every day atleast a few times. Just reminds me and I give up for the day, day ruined. Never conteplated suicide but im very close.  
  
Im 16M from eastern Europe and in a small town. My parents hate eachother all my life, my older brother was an accident and they got married because of that. My mum hoped my dad would get serious and be a good father but that never happened. Constant fighting, drunk all the time and physical abuse of my mum sometimes. Im the younger brother and missed a good portion because I was little, but my older brother remembers. I dont want to hate my parents all my life and blame them, all I want is to leave and forget it. My dad is in fact pretty lazy and acts like a crybaby for and old man like him. My mum is easily provoked and manipulated so I guess thats the fatal combo.  
  
We live in a small shitty soviet flat. Theres no young people here and if there are they move away after a year because its no place to raise kids. Only we stay. Its a one bedroom apartment that me and my brother share meanwhile mum and dad sleep in the living room. Literally everything is broken here – the toilet seats, old pipes with water that is never clean and - the never painted walls. Dont get me started on the walls, by the time I was 13 the entire bedroom wall was black from mold and my dad just didnt give a shit. No one enters this dungeon and I would be ashamed if they did. Never had friends or guests over in my life. I finally painted everything myself with paint i bought from the money my grandpa gave me. My grandparents are the only normal people I know. I tried installing a water filter in the sink so I could finally drink some clean water, but I messed it up and broke something. It caught a good amount of what I assume is rust, for that one week it worked.  
  
Now, what I hate most is that I LITERALLY DONT HAVE ANY FRIENDS. I have „people I know“, but never friends. I get home from school and volleyball (im pretty tall, 190cm, always been pretty tall although people in my country are like that) and no one to talk to. Never been to a birthday party, no one wants to go out with me, no one answers my texts. When we were kids everyone played with everyone and all, but as soon as I hit puberty everyone ghosted me, cause I was ugly. I guess for around 2 years I just didnt realise people started hanging out in groups and liking girls and all that. Got completely left out.  
  
Primary education lasts 8 years here and when I finished that literally no one from primary school ever talked to me again. I went to a big city to go to high school and start over again. Actually, i wanted to be in a dormitory so I didnt have to be home with my dad. I loved that school and actually met some new people (everyone was a nerd and im somewhat of a nerd too, straight A's always) but that dormitory was HELL for me. Way worse than my home and decided to go to school in my small hometown. I dont want to go in detail about the dormitory, but it was a falling apart 19th century building in a big eastern european city. Never got any sleep there because of my roommates and never got to do any work, yet I enrolled in the hardest school i could (idiot) and it was disgusting, 4 of us in a room of 15 square meters. Two bunk beds and a meter of space inbetween. Best thing was when the roommates got drunk and slept like babies – only time they left me alone. Usually they stole some stuff from me, bust a nut on my pillow and all that. Decided to just cut my losses and leave.  
  
Now in my hometown which is basically a village (2700 people) and along with the fact I made no friends here in 16 years and im just „the weird kid“ theres no one more to meet. Classes here consist of 10 students.  
  
TLDR: Im friendless, parents hate eachother and stuck in my village. I know most of you will say this is nothing terrible but im SAD EVERY DAY. No will to do anything, cause whats the point when no one likes me? Is the problem just my mind and things arent bad, or what? Inb4 kids in war zones in Donetsk have it worse, yeah, but over here everyone has it normal. Im the exception and a bad case.  
  
My only idea is to move to a bigger school but in a city thats near enough that I just take the bus. I could actually meet some friends in school, but no dormitory. I just dont think my father will allow it. Hes dissapointed and thinks I moved back just to fuck around because school was too hard in the city. He „thought i was serious, but now he sees im just a kid who thinks life is a joke“.

depression,My life thus far,"Hi!

I’ve reached a point in my life where I feel like I have to talk about the things I believe in.

One of the wisest things I’ve ever heard was “talk to someone as if they know something you don’t”. But I’ve always been reluctant to share my opinions on the Internet because of reasons that seem quite obvious to me - it's just not a very healthy environment. But, I think my skin got thicker over the years and now is as good a time as it ever was to just start talking. The thing is, I don’t really know what to talk about. But, that may be a good start.

So, from the beginning…

I was born in Brazil, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, so English is not my first language. I had quite a comfortable upbringing, I was lucky enough to be born in a family that always prioritized my education and my well-being, but we’re from the working class, and although we never really had a hard time with money, we never had the luxury of not being careful with it. To this day, my family doesn’t really pay much attention to financial health, apart from some people of my generation, so the future looks somewhat bright in that regard.

My parents never really had a great relationship. They never got married, and my dad lived in another state. Granted, he did whatever was within his reach to be close to me when I was a kid, but I didn’t have a father figure at home. I still don't. My mother never had a stable relationship with anyone. For me, it was always her and my grandmother.

I didn’t have the best adolescent years, I was quite a shy and weird guy, not to mention I didn’t really care much about the way I presented myself, so it was kinda tough to make friends and fit in a group. I didn’t really talk to girls, I was mortified with the idea of being rejected. And also, within those years, I had lost my grandmother - who was someone that was much closer to a mother to me than she could’ve possibly realized. So yeah, that was a big turning point for me.

All in all, my teens were a pretty rough few years up until a certain point. Regarding that, I received a prognosis on autism quite recently, so that actually explains a lot, but I feel like I’m sidetracking here.

But yeah, after that, I really started to cultivate better relationships and understand myself better. I got my first job teaching English when I was 17, and I tried my best to balance that with school, but that’s exactly when another big turning point happened. I had to move in with my grandparents on my dad’s side, because my mom was going through some major financial distress. My job wasn’t enough to pay the bills, and my mother was unemployed at 46 years old, in a failing economy.

So, I moved in with my grandparents right after graduating high-school and started to go to Law School. It was a very small town in the countryside of Brazil, a little under 40 thousand people at the time, it was cold as fuck, and it had very few things to do. So I drank a lot. Like, a lot a lot. But it was also at that time that I learned how to talk to women, and I actually started to put myself out there.

A few weeks after I moved in, my grandfather had a stroke, so, you know, not an ideal situation at all. But he was fine for a couple more years after that, I just had the added responsibility on top of school and my iternship at the time. Anyway, I studied Law for 3 years, before I realized it was not for me. By that time, my mother was already stable back in Rio, so I decided to come back and study Computer Science.

Guess what year it was by then. 2020. We all know what went down. Big changes in life, and in my relationship with my family, especially my mother. But, fast forward to 2022, I got a job in politics that had nothing to do with Computer Science, but I needed a way to make my money, and even though it’s pretty close to minimum wage, it’s enough to at least pull my own weight at home. I went through a very important relationship with a woman, I got a little doggy, who is the love of my life. And yeah… Slowly but steadily I’m figuring out stuff

So that’s my story so far. Even though I’m under no illusion of who I’m not, I have no idea who I am or who I want to be. And that’s quite frustrating to be honest. I have no prospects in the tech industry, as it stands. I have a job that will expire in four years, in the next elections. I’m unfocused and unsure of what I want for my future. But that’s all part of life, I guess. Nobody has everything figured out. And this is just my journey.

The purpose of this is to raise discussions on self-awareness. It’s a way for me to talk about the things I’ve learned and, hopefully, generate value to people who are in a similar situation or, idk anyone really.

depression,I am completely unmotivated in life,"I think this goes back some time in life. 
When I was in school/high school, I always did so good at school, in any subject, I always did great. I remember teachers always having high expectations for me when I went to uni, always wondering what I will study once I got there. The truth is, I myself didn’t even know it. I hated school, I hated studying, I hated every single subject. I went on and by the time I had to choose something to study, I chose Computer Engineering (just because, I thought it was a difficult major, and as I didn’t know what I wanted to study I might as well start with something I thought was difficult and then start moving back from that in case I didn’t like it, which was the case). I didn’t like it, so I enrolled myself in Chemical Engineering, I had to wait one semester so as to start the courses. I started my first semester, did well, and now I’m 21 on my 3rd year of Chemical Engineering. I have not enjoyed one single year since I started the career, I completely hate Chemical Engineering and cannot imagine myself working on anything related to it, but I really am afraid, I don’t want to leave it, I just want to graduate because I don’t want to lose any time, and I don’t think there is anything else I would like to study, like there isn’t anything that I am passionate about, I am not currently doing anything that I like, so everyday feels so monotonous, so boring, and I have reached a semester in which I have super specific subjects, and I just don’t have any motivation to study anymore, but I don’t want to fail this subjects because if I do I would have to re take them and that would mean 1 more year studying this career. I don’t know what to do, I am just so bored and tired of everything, and it seems like I am waiting to finish my career to start doing things I enjoy, so I want to finish it as soon as I can but I am slowly losing motivation to study.",0.144,0.111,0.744
depression,Baby steps to ,"Hey all, I hope you are well ♡ 
I was just wondering if I could ask for some insight?
 I lost my mum last year and honestly locked myself away. I took a month off work but have  been going everyday since.

I thought i was doing better when i started back, working from home til I was ready and eventually going back into the office to be around people again.
 Until I realised i come home and wait til its time to do it again.

I'm so grateful that was one lessons she always drilled into me from a young age. Turn up and smile, she didn't care what you what doing but as long as you where contributing to society and getting something positive out of it she'd support you -  work/ volunteering/ travelling or in education. It's all worth it. That's what I'm trying to get back to.

So how can I take the next step?

 I spent  Christmas day by myself and only saw my family because my other half physically left the party to brought me a plate and encouraged me to come for a drink. I managed a couple of hours.

I went out for my birthday with my dad but it's getting a bit awkward because I don't have alot to contribute to conversations anymore.

Iv missed out on family gatherings cuse I can't face them.

My friends do invite me to things and I love them but I haven't really seen my family since.  I have tried to have a few drinks with my cousins but tend to over compensate and am to much or kill the vibe and come home in tears.

I still make it to the end of my workday and am tears by the time I get to the train or if I get to tired. This happens less often now.

Please understand I'm not looking for sympathy, just some perspective - I know this is going to take a while and do recognise the positive changes - any tips on how to bridge the gap iv created with my family? They all rallied round and I just selfishly pushed away as hard as I could. 

Thanks for sticking with me- sorry it's so long
Where do I go from here? ♡

depression,I am in a bad place mentally lately,"So for a month I have been in a very bad place mentally. I dont know what really caused it, but I think because many bad things happened to me lately (which I wont talk about here because its long). For reference, my life has always been hard. My parents died at my young age, I lived with grandparents and my grandfather abused me emotionally and recently I had to move away from him and find my own place. Also I have pressure from uni. I guess maybe all this took me to this state in which I am now. I feel very depressed and have suicidal thoughts almost every other day. My mind is just filled with negative thoughts, I worry too much and just feel bad in general. Its like there is some darkness and pain in me which I cant get rid of. I cry all the time (without no reason). I worry and am scared that one day I will act on those thoughts and do something to myself. I know I am strong because I have been through much, but I just feel like there is no point carrying through all those bad moments in life and hoping it will get better. I mean I have some positive things in my life (friends, grandma who I love and who cares much about me, I go to uni for something that I want) but despite that I just still feel bad. I think I was depressed before and had panic attacks, and it got better but now I am feeling worse than I did then. I really wanna graduate and find my own happiness, but I dont have the will to study anymore and to do my duties. I have been to psychologist before but didnt continue because I had to move to my grandma in another town for a little while because I couldnt live with my grandfather anymore. Tommorow I will schedule appointment with one because I just cant live like this anymore. I wanna be happy again and want to wake up and go to sleep without feeling so bad. Also even though I have support from people in my life, I still feel alone in all of this. I am slowly feeling myself lose my spark and will to live. While I wait for my appointment, what are some ways to make myself feel maybe a little better and to get through this? ",0.133,0.219,0.648
depression,What if I'm actually just a bad person? ,"I don't know how to reconcile the feeling that I'm just a bad person. When I was a kid, I killed many animals, including pet rats and mice that did not belong to me, and I even killed a litter of kittens. I strangled our family cat when I was about 11 years old. I still remember him peeing on me as he lost bladder control as he died. 

I've read online that this is a sign of psychopathy as psychopaths lack empathy. They don't feel guilt, so they do this stuff because it doesn't bother them. The thing is, it did bother me, immensely. Even as a kid I felt immense guilt over doing those things. I'm not even sure how I was able to get up and function every day, I think I just distracted myself to not think about it. 

Now, as a man in his late 30's, I think about these things all the time. I didn't have pets for my whole adult life because I was horrified at what I had done as a child, even though I love animals. I love petting cats and dogs and I love watching animals in nature now and it makes me ill to think of what I did as a kid. I have NO IDEA why I did those things. My childhood was not great... my parents were abusive towards me a little bit, but honestly not that often, I can't make sense of why I would kill innocent animals. 

I finally got a cat again a few years ago and I was really good to her, but then she started peeing everywhere and I smacked her on the head. I realized that cats don't know right and wrong and can't be taught that something is wrong, like dogs can, and that hitting her was unjustified. I loved her and cuddled with her and took pictures of her every day, but I gave her away to an adoption agency because I don't trust myself with animals. 

I also attacked and bullied kids when I was a kid, for no reason. One time I was playing road hockey with some other kids and I just whipped the puck at this kid's face and gave him a really bad black eye. Why? No idea. I wasn't mad at him or anything, I just randomly did it.

depression,Is therapy actually worth it?,"  Been avoiding it for the last 4 years even though I’ve had suicidal thoughts for about half that time.

I think I mostly couldn’t do it out of fear and because I don’t think my mom deserves to lose her son in that way.

  For the last year I’ve been a lot better since I started working, I haven’t had a suicidal thought in many, many months but things are changing.  Just last night I was thinking about it and that scares me, I don’t want to do it, but if this is anything like last year then I assume in about a months time I’ll be thinking about it every night.

  I think I have autism (for good reason, I have all the symptoms and Ive had people who know autism really well ask me if I have it because they think I do).  I should get diagnosed, I just been to scared to get diagnosed because some people I know are under the impression that this new generation gets misdiagnosed for autism all the time because the number of people getting diagnosed is astronomical higher.  My parents have told me my whole life that I don’t have a mental disability every time I do something wrong (As if it’s themselves who they are trying to deceive).  

   I’m at the point where I been calling in sick a couple times a month and just laying in bed all day, watching anime.  And I really want to do something about it but as someone who hasn’t told a single person I know any of this I’m simply to scared people will think I’m crying for attention if I open up or try to go to therapy or get diagnosed with autism.

I have had a terrible life for most of my 28 years of existence. However, since I was 13 it spiralled down to almost to an ending.

Four years ago I had my first serious partner and she was good for the first year but then abused me for another two years until I finally escaped her.

My car needed major repairs so I had to take out a loan otherwise I'd lose my new job. My bills keep increasing and I no longer have anything to spend on myself as I can only afford to live off meal prepping. I no longer see my friends as I can't afford to go for drinks or do something in town together.

It tears me apart that i'm just stuck in this loop of constantly being bored out of my mind.. I just want to enjoy my free time, enjoy going on walks, enjoy playing games and hang out with friends. But i can't, i just fucking can't.

depression,Being poor is miserable.,"Since i was 12 me and my mom moved away from my abusive father , we moved across the country to a small 1 bedroom apartment.
Mom got a job there for almost a year but she was working minimum wage so she couldn’t afford paying rent and buying us food.
When i was 13 she said that i was grown enough and left the country to work abroad for a better pay , leaving me to live on my own with only my monthly allowance (50$) to live , for almost 3 months i lived off 3$ frozen pizza which i cut in half so it could feed me for 2 days , i was so malnutritioned that i lost 8kg and stopped growing in height till my mom came back , the only thing i could think  about in those times were money , thats why i choose an electricity profile highschool thinking that this job might give me the life i want in the future. 
When i was 14 mom came back with a friend of hers from the country she was working from and they both got a good paying job here back home , that irritated me because i just started getting into puberty and my privacy was walked all over since we still live in the same 1 bedroom apartment and to make it worse mom refused to recognize that i grew and she still changed / scratch herself whenever i was there too which made me uncomfortable to the point i was crying in the shower out of frustration. 
At the time i just couldn’t wait to move out as fast as possible so i googled how to make money fast as a teenager with no money , this lead me to a rabbit hole of school-work-sleep for the last couple years ears of my life , i have tried every online business that you can find on the internet, i bought countless of course , business emails , ads and in the last year trading wich all went in vain because i have made 0$ from all of those .
My breaking point was in january when my card declined on a 0.50$ toast and the guy behind me started laughing and paid for it , i never felt as small and unimportant as in that moment , something died in me that day , i stopped attending school , i stopped going outside , i stopped  trying to make any money , i just closed myself and started consuming media for hours on end .
Im almost 17 now and still live in the same bedroom with my mom , im failing all my classes and have almost 200 absences so if i continue school ill have to repeat the year. I still have no money after years of sleepless nights , i don’t want to victimize myself but what could i have possibly done differently to change my life , i feel like there is no end for me either than to end myself . i really don’t want to die but i rather be dead than to live like this 

Please don’t say in the comments that everything will be okay because it will not , i’ve lived this life for almost 5 years now , im sick of this never ever changing bs.

I don't even know where to begin with expressing my frustrations, I feel like I'm stuck here and can't progress in life. From the moment I arrived here and started working on this job, everyone expected me to be fluent in this foreign language like I've been here my whole life. The people in this country are theoretically one of the best non native english speakers in the world, but most of them refuse to speak it and if you somehow even dare to say a word in English they start being so hostile to you and they belittle you and make you feel like such a loser for doing that. My job is also shit, like I've said. I basically just unload baggage containers and throw the baggages on the conveyor belt while I'm being yelled at by someone for some unknown reason. I also have no friends because I don't know where to meet people and most of them ar now willing to speak English anyway, but even so, the very few people that speak English that I get to meet start ghosting me from some point, nobody really want to be friends with me...I know you're going to say that nobody forced me to move here and you're gonna tell me to go back to my country, or you're gonna say ""Why don't you move to an English speaking country if you want to speak English so much?"" Well, it's because I can't get a visa cause I don't have skilled work experience and a college degree and other bullshit, otherwise I would ASAP. And going back to my country isn't an option cause I hate it there even more than here, so yeah, I am really depressed about my life.

depression,My life has become a vertical line from a line graph,"I am a 21 years old in 3rd year college and I cannot see myself graduating.

I kept telling myself that if anything goes really bad it could determine the time when I really will kill myself, a habit I developed in the past year is writing a suicide note each time I feel really down to a friend that I deem to be the only one who deserved to read it and not anyone else, the drafts kept piling up my phone and yesterday I wrote another one I never sent them. Speaking of friends I already have a lot of instances where I finally knew that 'friends' may no longer be associated with me since it is understandable  that all of them have their own lives and priorities.

I really think I never grew up, I always seek attention and the interjections of quick realizations made me feel really embarrassed with myself, I feel left behind, all my peers seem to be successful a person whom a significant someone could tell them they're proud of them. 

I missed a lot of opportunities and I think I am the problem, I never have any talents nor achievements that could make myself valuable in the future nor today. I don't understand why I am too lazy and all this just made me blame myself and my existence even more

 My procrastination is becoming worse and I get into conflict with everyone but not being able to express it to them, I get angry now too quick but no nerve to show it.

depression,My battle with what I now know as depression,"I’m hoping this will be therapeutic. I’ve never really understood why I am the way that I am. I’m in my mid 20s and I see other people going about their days, doing things like exercising, cleaning, cooking, etc… things that will benefit them mentally and physically and I’ve never understood how. I have this sort of mental block that doesn’t allow me to help myself in any way. I’ll DoorDash food so I don’t have to go to the grocery store. I’ll leave my apartment in such a mess until I have to clean it before my girlfriend comes over. I don’t like to exercise or go outside in my free time because it doesn’t give me a serotonin boost and I find it boring. 

I constantly think so negatively about myself and it’s part of the reason why I don’t do things to benefit me. Some days I don’t even look in the mirror because I dislike the person looking back at me. I moved to a new city a few years ago and haven’t made a single friend outside of work because I don’t have any sort of self confidence to put myself outside of this depressed bubble of mine. I engage in self destructive habits because it’s not like I deserve any different… it’s like I put myself down and then kick myself because I put myself down (if that makes sense). 

I just don’t see a future version of myself that includes kids, a home, etc. because it doesn’t bring me any sort of excitement. The world bores/worries me constantly and I don’t know how to look at it in the same manner that most people seemingly do. When will I sit down and realize that this is never going to change unless I become proactive about it? I’m just so damn tired of myself that I don’t know how I can make that shift to help myself.

I don’t know what to do. I’ve spent literally all of 2020-2024 laying in my room alone watching YouTube or playing Xbox. It still feels like 2020 to me.

I was bullied so bad that I’ve felt nothing but hate for myself since I was 13. I went all those years not once having even the smallest glimmer of self confidence. I was bullied so bad that even now at 25 I’m too scared to go out in public in my home city because I’m scared to see people who know me. I waited 5 years to even consider college because I didn’t want to go somewhere and have an old classmate see me and tell people all the reasons I used to be bullied which would make it hard for me to make friends. I waited for everyone in my graduating class to finish college to even think about starting. I’m also too scared to date or use dating apps cause I’m so ugly and disgusting. I don’t want to go out with a girl irl then have someone I went to school with run into us and try to humiliate me.

I feel trapped. I can’t move out of my parents house  because I have a 400 credit score, $0 in savings, 20K in credit cards that got charged off cause I stopped working and making payments entirely over a year ago. 

I have so many lies going. I lie a lot to people irl because I’m so ashamed of the truth. I’m 6’5 and never played sports but I’ve told so many people at jobs and other places that I played football just because if they see how tall I am, they’ll think I’m a loser for not playing sports. I lied to all my old irl friends in 2020 about having a girlfriend and having sex and stuff because I was so ashamed of being a 21 year old virgin that I literally made up an entire girl and said she was a coworker which is why theyve never seen her. It got too exhausting keeping that lie going so silently left that friend group. I didn’t make a scene or anything, I just ghosted them all out of shame and guilt for lying to them. Now here I am a 25 year old virgin.

I’ve also lost a lot of friends cause a few old friends of mine told me that until I get a girlfriend and show them, they’re gonna be convinced I’m a faggot and they don’t want to associate with me. Afterwards they went and told all of our mutual friends that I’m a gay(I’m not btw). I’ve never had any relationship experience because girls dont like worthless losers which is all I am so there no point in trying in the first place. Who would ever want to date the fat disgusting loser with no friends and money and no respectable job and followers on social media and no place of their own and no cool car and no cool hobbies and no college degree.

The only way out feels like suicide.

For context I’m 23 M. For a large part of my life I’ve felt like a ghost passing through peoples live and showing no impact on the lives of people. i’m not saying I had to save a life or be known for something crazy but majority of my friends are distinct in their own ways and have something that makes them stand out to others. For me it feels like I’m someone who is just a nobody and it doesn’t help that I feel like that. I always code switch depending on the group of people that I hangout with but it doesn’t feel like there is anything connected throughout all my groups of friends that makes me, well me. For example my friend is out of pocket but he’s also an asshole he has a tough love type of attitude. You ask how I am and I couldn’t even tell you. I’m really just the quiet one or reserved type. Truth is I don’t even know who I am or how I was able to make friends with the people I have today. I have anxiety and social anxiety so that contributes in some ways but it’s just the lack of self identity that I struggle with and it sucks majorly because I wanna make friends, I want to have experiences and fun relationships with people. I want to be the charismatic and funny person or strong and confident person who doesn’t take shit from anyone. I lack these characteristics and don’t know what defines me. When Im with my friends they tell me about their past summer experience and how much fun they had with their jobs, the new people they met and their prospective plans. I wish for these experiences I want to be the one who has friends to catch up with at social gatherings, I wanna have the confidence to speak my mind, I wanna have stories to tell and be someone who matters to someone or thinks of me when it comes to hanging out. I’m always just a final thought in someone’s head. I always hate when someone says “who’s that” or can’t even memorize my name, because that’s how forgettable I am. The biggest thing for me is how much I hate myself, I always tell myself to be confident and I even put myself in situations like going to social gatherings that I know I’m not gonna want to go to but go either way for hope that I somehow improve my social skills. I hate myself so much because I imagine the type of person I could be but am too afraid to see. No defining traits of mine and nothing worth spending time with.

My friends know I've been struggling mentally for years but I think that they're finally starting to give up on me. I seldom respond in group chats and when I do it's mainly reactions that are missed in conversation anyway.

I also think that my friends now have some sort of resentment towards me. I'm still in the chat and they go out together, posting pictures and say it's 'squad goals' or that 'all of the girls are here', fully knowing I'm still there - I may be reading too deeply into this though.

depression,I can't take it anymore,"I know this is a bit longer but please, give it a shot.  
I'm just a guy who wanted to live a normal life, to be loved, to not be in pain on a daily basis, to be accepted, mostly by myself, to do what I love. My life struggles have accumulated and I am in a really dark place. I often ask why I am so unlucky, why me?   
I started life with big disadvantages: being a sensible kid, learning generalized anxiety from my neurotic mom and also getting slow processing speed from her , a condition in which my brain works slower, which makes my life much harder than of a normal person. I've been bullied from the age of 5 to the age of 19, by my sister, my other kids at school, by the playground kids, even from girls, which resulted in deep shame of everything I was doing and no self esteem. I don't know how I got something else called overresponsability, in means that I assume that a lot of my action hurts people and I feel guilty all the time. Being a nice guy also, in the bad way. I live in a toxic family.  
Through all my college I tried to get a girlfriend which of course failed due to the problems above. I've read books, went to therapy, did self improvment, gratitude, meditation. Nothing worked. I'm 25 and really sexually frustrated and think of women all the time (and dreaming them).  
I am finishing medicine next year, which is another fail actually, because I learned very little, and I don't know if I can manage the work since I am slower and socially anxious.   
Always struggling to talk to people and be myself. Every interaction is a hell. People now say I am awkward, crazy and stupid.   
Since 17 I started having back problems, very often I couldn't even stand without pain, my love of sports is severely limited. I did a lot of physical therapy, swimming, but it failed.  
Since 2022 I have diarrhea everyday, internal hemorroids, abdominal pain, abrasions at the butt hole from that much paper towel. I went to doctors, tried medication ,changed my diet, but it failed.  
Since 2019 I keep going to psychotherapy, but it failed also. Still anxious, still depressed, still fragile, still low self esteem, still awkward.  
Still the same.  
And problems keeps coming, instead of resolving. Recently my knees started to hurt harder, despite not running anymore, my left eye is blurry sometimes after I sit on the left side, and 5 days ago, my penis started hurting, despite I didn't do anything with it.  
I am not a coward, lazy person, nor a complainer. I did everything I had in my power to make things better, to enjoy life. I know I didn't really do EVERYTHING, cuz there is always more you can do, but anything I mustered the courage to do and was accesible. But what do you do when nothing works out, when you live in pain every day, when you're tired of it all?  
You have a challenge in your life, you first complaint about it, you do something about it, you fail, you try another approach new, you fail again, and that's ok, it was your first attempts, you tell yourself to keep going, that failure is the stepping stone of succes. But what if you keep failing endlessly? What do you do if the pain is greater day by day? What should I do?  
I have 3 tests next week, and after that, another 3 exams in just one week, and so on. I don't know how in the hell I'm gonna pull it off while feeling like crap. The last thing I want to do is to study.

 I should have dealt with this illness years ago and this wouldn’t have happened but foolish me thought I could self medicate with alcohol which did help make me feel good but the cost was too much.

Am starting therapy soon and I’ve rejoined the gym after a decade of gaining weight due to over eating and drinking. Lost lists already after cutting the rum and whiskey out.  

But Jesus I regret it. Am afraid I won’t find another like her. Hate this illness and what annoys me is there other people that suffer this or worse but they have there lives together good relationships just makes me hate myself as I could have had all this. 

All I am thinking at the moment is I want a new career something I love for once as I was disqualified for the other jobs due to my illness. Just want some happiness and a fulling career.

 I have a girlfriend and tbh she is the best person I have here, she loves me a lot as I do her, but I can't even talk to her bcs we are two completely different person, I am good listener, she talks i listen and she try to listen to me also but she can't understand me, like most of the times I need someone who have their goals , who have ambition, i need someone like me who understands me to talk to, someone who are focused on them, who wants to work on them, most people here are just completing their degree, destroying their body and I toxicated whole time, due to this I feel very lonely, but I have been dealing that since last 4 year and I was able to cope with the help of physical activities (gym , running)but I had a health issue 2 months back and doctor advised bed rest and I can't even sit of longer duration to study, I can't go to gym I cant go to ground, so now I am feeling more and more of it, sometimes I feel anxiety and sometimes I have very depressing thoughts, thinking to share it with my girlfriend but she emotionally very sensitive and she will get so anxious about all this and then she will try to correct everything and I will get more disturb ( she cares about me a lot and sometimes she does not realise that she keep checking upon me every 15 min, that are you fine, it also stress me out) .",0.099,0.112,0.789
depression,"""Fuck em"", works till it doesn't","I (39M) have finally decided I will be leaving and its the only thing that brings me peace now. For me being alone isn't transitory it really has been like this my whole life and much of it is my fault, the meanness that I was raised on I brought forward in my life because monkey see, monkey do. I know that might sound like a cop out but it's true you only know what you are shown and taught, you model yourself on the experiences you have with the people around you.

I was the youngest of four, getting pregnant again in the 80's was a disaster for my mother and she made sure I knew it throughout my childhood, every once in awhile she would enjoy telling us all at the kitchen table about the accident I was (My eldest sister and older brother loved this story in particular). I don't understand why it made me try harder for her love, I'll never not be embarrassed about that.

When I was very little, about 6+, my father loved to bully me, he would wait until my older brothers friends were around because ""Watch this, this poor fucker goes mad!"" - (I still remember the smile on his face when saying this) one day I told him to fuck off and he literally chased me up the road until he caught me and beat the shit outta me in front of said brothers friends and neighbors, I still remember them all laughing, that wasn't the first beating or the last he liked to use the computer power cable or branch from an ash tree out the back, my mother would say that ""You can't speak to yer father like that"", I got used to telling him to fuck off and I got used to the beatings.

I became sensitive and quick tempered a bad mix but made more dangerous by being able to take a punch (and give one tbf) so I hurt anyone who said shit to me and people always said shit to me, I think they could read off me that I was expecting it, so they delivered, I always thought that was weird that people would happily go around giving other people shit but when they won the only prize available to them (a punch in the mouth) they'd cry foul. I got used to telling people to fuck off and I got used to being alone.

Finding out the old man was a closet case during my early teenage years was fun, constantly wondering if other people know or will they find out, on the plus side it was the only thing that got the fucker outta the house every once in awhile, that fuckin loser was long jobless by that stage, I call him that because he really did believe most types of work were beneath him so instead of doing anything else he just took ma's money, I didn't like her but at the same time at least she put food on the table.   


I can't say I didn't meet a few nice people over the years but by then I didn't know how to nurture relationships so all of them fizzled out, anyway, I don't even know where this is going, oh yeah, finishing up, byeeeeeeeee.

depression,I was just humiliated by people that say they're my friends.,"I have severe anxiety and depression, and I use VR to socialize. I have some VR ~~friends~~, some of whom I've known for years. Tonight, I joined them to meet their other friends, but I didn't say much at all. I just sat there for hours, overthinking. All of them are smarter and more successful than me and I feel inferior to everyone anyway.

They took me to an improv world I'd never been to before. I figured I could just watch. However, the audience had to participate by suggesting words and topics through a dialog. Only me and one other friend was in the audience, so I had to choose around 15, but I couldn't think of *one*. They were all waiting on me to start, but my anxiety was so intense that I was barely able to speak, let alone come up with funny words for them to use. Panicking, I thought I could just enter random words instead of funny ones, hoping it might work like Cards Against Humanity where maybe they could use the word for something creative anyway. For one prompt asking for an adjective, I entered ""cocaine"". By the fourth or fifth word, another prompt asked for an adjective, and I hesitated, feeling guilty about not providing valid or good answers. Eventually, they just started the game without waiting any longer, and I was thankful.

However, I could hear them talking, which was unexpected. They commented, ""He doesn't even know what an adjective is,"" based on my topic words.

During a scene, one of them joked, ""Hey, that dress is very cocaine,"" and they all laughed. Then, another added, ""Uhh... I think I need to go back to school,"" followed by another asking, ""**You** do?!"" and they all laughed really hard. I just exited the app. I haven't felt this bad since 2020.",0.168,0.093,0.739

Or are things fine right now and I’m just not used to feeling fine? Or am I sad? How do you guys deal with the cloud? 

I do go for therapy, I’m on Venlafaxine and I’ve got a good support system but it’s days like these that just… puts me in a very odd position in my head. It’s like a dull ache that you can’t pinpoint and it’s annoying.

And when I bring it up to my therapist, the question is always: “Why?”. I don’t know why. Must there be a cause for everything? Must I delve so deeply into the root of this cloud all the time? It’s so tiring. Can’t I be sad because I just am, at the moment at least? 

I don’t want to die. I love my friends and my family and I look forward to the people that I’ll be able to meet, the experiences that I’ll have. But at the same time, living is so exhausting.

depression,in need of advice ,"Hello r/depression, I've created this account just so I can share my problem and get some possible feedback and help. 
for the past year or so, my dad has moved away to a town 2h away from us because of work. Everything has been okay, his relationship with my mom is not the best but it's okay. They vid call each other and talk about their day and vid call with our relatives. They do fight sometimes but i believe it's like any married couple. However my dad has started developing some problems. We'll technically the problems started a while back before he moved away. 
So my dad works at a job where he's ""active on the field"" and he's in charge, so he's always getting calls from his bosses or co-workers and he's a very hard worker almost too hard working, however, after some problems have happened in his work, he moved to another position where he only works from his desk, so he's not as active as he used to be. That sent him into a spiral, he stopped talking to my mom or to us. stopped eating and stopped hanging out with us. any tiny disagreement with my mom and he starts going crazy, he starts bringing up very very old arguments They had and very very old family matters, like before I was even born kind of old. One time he like pushed my mom a little bit, not enough for her to fall or anything but he did technically become ""physical"" so I went out of my room and screamed at him to not put his hands on her. guess what he did? he held me up high by my neck and started screaming ""m gonna throw u in the ocean you and your mom"" keep in mind I'm a 5""2 a fairly petite and he's 6""1 or 6""2. 
(side note: he never layed a hand on me before or on my mom or sister or anyone)
I did not talk to him that week and he was trying to sweet talk me into forgiving him, and buying random food and giving me money.
skip forward to 2 months when he got his usual ""active on field"" job back. and he started doing better and laughing more and being ""happy"" and didn't argue with my mom are any of us ever again. 
until these last few months and especially these past 2 or 3 weeks. he stopped answering to my mom's calls or his mom's calls (my grandma), he occasionally answers my calls tho.
my mom went to the town where he's staying at to visit him and found the house in a very bad state (cleanliness wise), he started arguing with her for seemingly nothing, like bringing up any argument he can. and my mo said that he's in a very bad state, she said ""he looks like the very depressed ppl we see in movies"", I hope that helps clear up the image. 
we can't move to where he's at, because I have a very important exam coming up (final year of highschool), so pls don't suggest moving cz that's out of the picture for now.
My mom asked me for help but I'm very clueless and idk what to do, so here I am asking for advice from anyone that might be a professional or has any similar experience.

depression,I am tired of new beginnings and fighting to get better…,"Hi everyone

I just need to vent somewhere..

I was depressed as a teen and young adult. 7!years ago I completed a bachelor degree only to realize I don’t want to work in that field and I also broke up 8-year long relationship. No job. I was at point zero. 

Then, for the past four years I was able to gather strength and change my ways, improve my life and live fairly depression-free. I gathered mental strength to get another degree, I had a well-paying job I really enjoyed(although unrelated to either of the degrees), could afort to live comfortably and eat healthy, travel and invest in myself. 

I have a small health issue that requires surgery, so I moved briefly to live with with my parents so that I can save money to solve it faster, and have even passed driving test and was saving for a car. I even started going to the gym and was finally feeling like I am going somewhere in life. 

However, all of that happiness and effort went down the drain in the past 3 months:

- i was laid off at work 3 months ago, so now I’m unemployed. From a job that was my dream job(remote position)
- my grandma who was living with us, who really supported and understood me, died 2 months ago
- The money I was saving for solving my health issue and getting a car is now being spent on surviving as I don’t want to ask for money from my parents. 
- I found an indent on my breast 2,5 months ago and went through detailed health checkups for breast cancer. THANK GOD they found nothing, but having to go through the process for a few weeks was terrible. Apparently I tore my chest muscle at the gym. I was so full of fear…
- Love life is so dead that I am pretty certain it will never improve. I don’t care about romance as much, but I do worry about staying on my own in a world full of uncertanity. Who am I going to turn to when parents get old?

So, where things stand now, I am a 32 year old woman, living with my parents, in my small home town, with no job, and no prospects of having family on my own anytime soon. Zero stability on all fronts of life. It doesn’t help that my country is plunging deeper into the abyss, with the worst government we’ve had in the past 20 years, and the world is facing a major economy crisis. 

Relationship with my mother is shaky, as she is as impatient for me to move out as I am. I feel like such a failure. I was lucky that I had where to turn (family home, sister and bff for support), but I realized that parents are getting older, and instead of me taking care of them, they are now taking care of me. How pathetic. It especially hurts me that my father, who is the only provider in the home at the moment, also has health issues. 

I am not siting idle. I am preparing a portfolio and updating my software skills to try to get a job as a designer ( my second degree), but also actively looking for other compatible positions. If I don’t get a job in my niche, I will look for any job very soon.

The thing is I just feel so hopeless and tired of life. I became hyper aware of human mortality and I feel so weak emotionally and mentally that a new beginning (new job, new people, new city) feels like a punishment, even though I need it and will have to face it regardless. I am not sure if I can pull this off mentally. 

I feel very, very defeated and hopeless about the future. Everything is just too much. I am tired of having to struggle every time. I just feel like throwing the towel and letting life happen as it wants to because apparently my efforts to help myself didn’t last very long. I just can’t go through stupid new beginnings anymore…

depression,How can I help my friend? ,"Sorry for the bad format, I'm on my phone. 

My friend 16F is depressed. Deeply depressed. Her mother is a narcissistic asshole that thinks her basic duty as a mother is to put her daughter down, besides that my friend had a big move to a whole other continent and has some important exams coming up and overall she's just depressed. 

She's been okay somedays but the thing with having depression as long as her (4 years) is that you grow very comfortable with being sad, that your natural mood all the time itself is being sad. She's recently gotten a new crush, one that she has literally no way of getting together with (my friend is bisexual and her crush is as straight as a plank. It's a girl.) They've recently become friends and my friend texts her all the time, they stay up to ungodly hours talking and I could say my friend has literally forgotten that the world exists. I am expected to celebrate every little achievement they have together (calls for longer than 8 hours, been friends for 2 weeks, etc) but she doesn't notice anything that happens to me. I admit this has caused some resentment considering I've been friends with her for 12 years (I'm 17 now fyi) and being such close friends for a long time, you'd expect your friend to notice. Then she added me in a group chat with crush and they're the same class so they talk a lot, and leave me out of a lot of context and inside jokes so that's caused some more resentment but overall I love my friend and being friends for so long, we've gone through much more than this. 

As you can guess, the crush has a lot of side effects such as being more depressed because she constantly thinks about how she never has a chance with her crush and so on and wasting all her time instead of studying. Over the past week she has recognized this as a problem and keeps talking to me about it, asking me for advice and stuff and I say the basic things like distract yourself, stop talking to crush so much, stop being so comfortable with sadness, it's okay, take small steps.

Then she'll be like it's okay, I'll throw myself into studies and it won't matter that much. Then she won't study and continue talking to her crush and then next day she'll come back and ask for advice and I say the same thing and the cycle goes on. 

I've told her to get a therapist but she says it's too expensive and her mother would judge her for it. I admit therapy here is veryyy expensive and her mother would judge her, but she also has a sister who is going to therapy and is also working and definitely wouldn't mind spending some money for her younger sister to go to therapy too.

depression,Trying and failing really hard lately,"I think I've started to hit a real wall and come to my wits end these days.  

Lately, I've just been feeling like all I do is try my best and yet that gets me nowhere or it's just not good enough for anyone.  I just can't seem to win anywhere between my work life which grinds me down between entitled customers and demanding bosses.  Then there's my personal life, where I'm trying to keep a relationship together but no matter what I do or say, that's not good enough.  

It's gotten to the point that I've started self-harming.  And it's not just cutting.  I've gone as far as punching myself.  Banging my head against hard surfaces.  And even starving myself.  

Yet, people thing it's to get attention or to have a coping mechanism.  

Truth is, I self harm because I want to damage myself to the point that maybe I won't come back.  That maybe I'll hurt myself enough that I would finally die.  

And I have tried reaching out and even done a lot when it comes to medications.  So far, I've taken escitalopram, citalopram, cymbalta (duloxetine), sertraline, fluoxetine, Fetzima, and now desvenlafaxine.  Even including Trazodone to help me sleep.  

Not really sure if it'll work but I just can't help but want to just go to sleep and never wake up.  Especially if my life is going to just keep on going like this.  ",0.104,0.155,0.742

I have some good friends but most of them are already working and I’ve been feeling left out and isolated from them and like they’re part of an exclusive club I can only ever hope of joining. I’m in a different stage of life and am depressed about my future. This is a huge change for me yet none of my friends are going through it. I feel constantly left behind and out of the loop and just excluded from everything. None of my friends can really understand and I feel like they don’t even care about me. It’s like I’m just a side character in the story of my life. I’m never anyone’s first choice and probably never will be, I’m just a 22 year old loser who took an extra year of college because of depression and is too weird for people to like and have barely dated anyone let alone kissed someone. I know that my friends care about but, but emotions don’t always agree with logic. I know they care about me,  but do they even like me? I feel like my talk about me being depressed lately has annoyed them and I desperately don’t want to lose them but I’m one bad thing from having a mental break down. I want to talk to them but I don’t want to annoy them or bring them down or burden them. I know people care for me but it doesn’t feel like that sometimes. I feel so selfish for talking about my problems when they have much worse problems than me. I’m always the one reaching out never them so maybe it’s a problem with me. 
I feel like I’m losing my sense of self because I try to always be amusing and fun while inside I’m just broken. I’m just a sidekick even in my own story and everyone prefers my best friend to me (I don’t blame them she’s so much better than me in every way)
I don’t want to burden my parents because they don’t deserve to have such a messed up daughter who can’t handle her emotions. They deserve someone competent and mature. I don’t want to stress them out or make them upset, even though I know they’ll support me, I just don’t want to admit that I’m afraid.

* I can't do efforts anymore. Taking a shower or doing other every day tasks is a big victory for me. Even brushing my teeth feels like an impossible task. 
* I don't have any drive to do anything anymore. I gave up on my hobbies. I still love them and would like to do them, it's just that I don't do them anymore. 
* I can't take care of myself anymore, be it physically or by cleaning my apartment, or taking care of the paperwork I have to do. I've had a water leak in my bathroom for months now and I don't fix it.

depression,Feeling deep loneliness ,"Hi, this is my first post here. Idk how to start this but I’m a 20 yr old female, I’m in uni and obviously I’m posting on here because I’m very lonely. It’s like a deep loneliness that I can physically feel in my chest, it’s been like this since I was a kid. I hate talking about it with people because I fear that it makes me feel pathetic or weird. But online it’s different because nobody can see my face on here.

Part of this loneliness comes from autism. I’m not diagnosed yet, but I’m suspecting I’m autistic and if I am I think that’s where a lot of the loneliness stems from. I feel like I don’t relate to people, I feel like an alien among everyone, I always feel weird and strange like I don’t belong, and I’m always masking to try and seem “normal.”

I’ve never had a boyfriend, never had a main best friend either. All the people I’ve considered my best friends have always had a closer friend than me. I feel like I’m always the second choice in things, like I’m not important enough or outgoing enough or good enough to actually be chosen first for once. 

It hurts a lot, like really hurts. I’ve felt like crying all day. But I can’t cry anymore because of all the times I’ve forced myself to not cry. I feel very broken inside and like nobody understands. People say they get it but I feel like they really don’t, like they’re just saying that to be nice.

depression,How do I make the most of the next 10 years?,"I plan to commit suicide within the next 10 years.

So anyways - the real question: how can I provide society the greatest benefit in the next decade?

depression,Ignored by my son ,So today is 'Mothers Day' where I am. My son is 28. We've had a rocky relationship growing up. His behaviour has caused me to develope serious depression over the years. I would say at the moment I am at my worst. He knows this. Doesn't know directly that he's been the cause. He wouldn't believe me if I said so anyway. I've tried telling him how I'm feeling and the thoughts I've had. He's given me the impression that he just doesn't care. I found out he was spending today with his less than a year in girlfriend and her family. I was taken back by this and very upset. He said he'd come and make dinner for me. It's almost 6pm and I've had not one message acknowledging my existence by him. I'm struggling to understand how he can be so heartless. It was my birthday a couple of weeks ago and he came after dark and made dinner. Then left me for a bit to go off and do whatever with his gf. His reason for not spending anytime with me on my birthday? He had to help his gf sister do whatever. I'm so hurt by this. I've just started seeing a psychologist so it's very early days. I live on my own with my 2 dogs and only have one kid. I've had more love from my dogs today than he has ever shown. I know he has no respect and hates me even though he says he doesn't. This sort of behaviour towards me has cemented that feeling. How do I cope with a kid who knows how depressed I am but doesn't give a fuck? If i tell him how I feel I'm made to feel it's my fault.

Then I'd travel to some other city somewhere and start over elsewhere. It's like I crave affection and don't want it when I get it. All I want is to be loved and when someone loves me I fall back. Is it possible to be incapable of love? Because that's how I feel too. 

I've never been in love before. I faked it once. Almost got married even. Had a few friends hit me up that were genuinely concerned for my mental well being because getting married is not me. I tried to pretend I was that guy. I didn't love her. I was selfish. She genuinely cared for me and I was tired of running. We're actually decent friends still and play video games together when I'm still for long enough. Maybe it's adhd that makes me this way? Maybe it's the lack of love from my childhood? That's probably it right there. Bingo idiot that's obviously it. How do you get past that though? I didn't have affection growing up. There were no hugs, or ""i love you,"" or talks, or teachable moments. I was just suppose to be quiet and preferably emotionless. Pesky kids and their emotions lol

Two years ago now was the first time I cried in 22 years. I've wanted to. It wasn't like ""oh I'm a tough man and tough men don't cry"" even though that's pretty much how I was raised. No it was like I literally couldn't cry. I wanted to be an actor because I had figured out I could get myself to tear up slightly when I spoke a good dramatic monologue. I think I was 8 or 9 when I stopped crying. I was being bullied at school for being too emotional and my dad actually whooped me for crying then I sort of just stopped. 

There's a lot to unpack, but I'm not going for the ""woe is me"" bit. There are many people in the world much worse off than me. I just want to know how to get past this. How to just love someone? Idk how do you be normal? Only less normal. I so can't conform to anything.",0.194,0.149,0.657

We have been absolute best friends for 11 years and I couldn’t believe it and when I talked to her family about why this could’ve happened they seemed so confused
I don’t know how to transition this well bc I don’t want to leak it in case her family finds out, but she lied to me about the university she attended, so much more stuff, and the worst thing she lied about was how she was struggling so bad about her brother committing
Except I found out they never even committed because they never even existed
I’m just like
I was your best fucking friend and you are going to lie to me about all this ?? I opened my home to you, I let you cry about a dead brother that was never dead, 
When I talked to her parents all her lies came out and I just can’t believe it like
I don’t even know who she was 
I’m so confused whether I should be grieving her or if I should be hating her it’s so much 
Before you all ask me about how I didn’t know about this fake sibling, her family life is 100% fucked up (I know this 100%) and so I was never really around them because she tended to literally live with me growing up because my family took her in and I just never wanted to pry into the death because I know it “rattled her so much” and I assumed it was a step sibling and I never met her dads new family because she hated being around them

depression,Walking Dead,"30M. Not sure why I’m here. Maybe screaming into the digital void helps a little? I don’t know…

I was SA’d when I was 19-20. I was in the military at the time. Nobody I worked with or knew, I was just unlucky or stupid enough to not notice I had been being followed…

I couldn’t tell anyone, the military was the only option I had to ever go to school or make anything of myself. So I had to hide the shame away. So I hid away. I started going outside less and less. Talking to people less, eventually every social interaction became a labor intensive process. Constantly masking to not arouse suspicion that ANYTHING was wrong. 

I did my 5 years in what felt like hell. I was drunk for a good bit of it. It felt like everyone was a threat, everyone was out to get me for something, didn’t matter what, or if you even did it, if it LOOKED like you did it. Then you’re guilty. “Perception is reality shipmate” still fills me with rage. This on top of shitty leadership, long hours, etc etc. I attempted once while I was roving watch one day, but I guess the round was a dud or the shitty old M4 didn’t work, either way.

Tried marriage, tried to “retake” my identity as a bisexual man. It didn’t work, I spent that entire relationship scared of that man. I hated going home because I would just be yelled at there too. I had it in my head that I NEEDED to make it work. But it didn’t. 

I tried working in the civilian world but it never took. I can’t stand being around people so if there’s ever an opportunity to finish early I’d take it just to be alone for 5 minutes in my car before I went home to get screamed at by a man who wasn’t working at all. Even housework. 

We got a house that I eventually had to deal with because I was a moron with the paperwork/loan. He RUINED my credit. To this day it’s not gone up at all. Almost 4 years after I paid off all the debts. I had to take out a loan to creamate my mother after she died of colon cancer in 2019. I still can’t show my face to any of my extended family, beyond the shame of being damaged goods, I had failed as a man.

I attempted again with pills and alcohol, threw it all up. Just decided to go on a self destructive bender until I was dead of an overdose or whatever health problem got to me first.

It was here that I met my now GF (Fiancé?). We met on a subreddit and I decided to go see her. It felt completely different. It felt like actual affection.

After a while I decided to leave my home state and drove 1200 miles away to move in with a woman who at the time is only known for a few months. With my backup plan being to blow my brains out if it didn’t work out. 4 years later I’m still here. 

She loves me. She loves me “more than anything ever” and I believe it. But I wish she didn’t…

I feel like Jerry, like the worm who deceives people into pitying him. I feel like I’m doing it now. I am poison. I feel like a collection of constantly warring neurosis’ in a trench coat more than I do anything else. I don’t feel enjoyment from anything anymore. I hate being awake.

She’s done nothing but support me and all I ever do is TAKE. I know eventually she’ll get sick of me…I tried going back to school, I failed because I couldn’t focus due to all the people and social interactions. Despite people being kind to me, I can’t accept it. I can’t bring myself to accept help…my GF MADE me file for VA disability. Honestly I’d probably already be dead without her.

I don’t know what she sees in me that makes her keep me around…I can’t go to crowded places, I cry after or during sex, I have to take a cocktail of meds just to function. It’s pathetic. I can’t even finish school much less find an employer who’ll put up with my bullshit.

 I still can’t be alone with men, I won’t be intimate with one ever again. And it’s made me hate myself and all men…every time I look in the mirror I see this creature that wants to be put down but can’t be…a creature who loathes itself and everything like him…I don’t want to transition or anything like that. But I hate being one all the same. Honestly I think I’m just too weak, if I was better then I’d be able to deal with it. But I am weak. I am a coward that hides from the world.

It's weird. At first I thought it was good that most days I feel alright. But I realized I'm just anxious every single day because of my OCD. I can no longer feel strong emotions or connect emotionally to much. I haven't had a hyperfixation in over a year and it sucks so much. I feel like i dont have much identity or interests. Everything seems boring or just gives me anxiety because of my OCD, so i cant enjoy much anymore. I also cant really emotionally connect to people without severe anxiety and end up isolating myself, so i dont really have close friends. Or i have friends who call me their best friend and i feel like shit that i just dont reciprocate it even though i want to, i just get too anxious to let myself attach. Everytime I think about my life too long i just spiral. Sometimes things make me cry even though i dont 'feel' sad. It's weird feeling 'happy' and still thinking your life sucks, but just not feeling sad about it. I started remembering what it was like when i was much worse off and I miss it. 

I dont know what's wrong with me. I must be pretty fucked in the head to want to be worse again, but I do. I'm relapsing in my ED again too. I dont know if im getting bad again or just trying to induce it on myself. But at least I'm in a good mood. 🤷🏾",0.187,0.211,0.602
depression,Feeling clearer with alcohol.,"Umm so i definitely depressed. It’s been on and off for years but I’ve hit an all time low. i have been to a psychologist when i was younger but recently has been the first time a psychologist has finally told me I have textbook depression which I appreciated as when I was younger I thought I was being overdramatic and my feelings were just a normal reaction to things going on. 

I’m going to drop out of university cuz i just felt like there was no point in doing my exams and currently i’m just at this place where i feel like it’s all so pointless. We live and we die. Rn I’m seeing a therapist twice a week, I had avoided alcohol due to my depression but as I’m dropping out I will have to go back home. 

When i was depressed at 15, my motivation was to just finally leave home. in the past, i attempted to take my life and a month later I probably would’ve died by choking on my puke if someone didn’t find me in the park passed out due to me drinking a bunch but that was not an intentional taking of my life. I do not believe my parents are awful but in my opinion they weren’t good parents but I do understand they were going through a lot. They got divorced which was fine with me but it was rlly messy. My dad cheated and my mum went on this path of getting revenge or “justice” as she would call it. I lived with my mum as I didn’t have the heart to leave her, no matter how badly she treated me by constantly putting me in the middle and using me as her punching bag (to clarify not physically, just if something went wrong she’d just somehow make it my issue to put it all simply. My parents became so consumed with their issues, there was no room for me and i felt alone with all my problems but again that birthed my passion to go to uni to get away.

Rn I realized that my problems don’t just go away and now my only crutch (going to uni) is gone because I couldn’t stay happy and now i just feel lost. I don’t have any hobbies and no actual passion for anything. I have friends but i feel like I can’t rely on them because I think it’s unfair to put my life in their hands and they r also quite awkward with shit like this like they don’t know how to respond except things get better. I don’t want to live my life working to make money and then enjoy it later because i never had that goal. My only goal was to make money but I realize now I wouldn’t even know what to do with the money as I have nothing that actually drives me.

Anyways to get on the topic. I started drinking cuz I’m going home in a couple of weeks and I wanted to do things that I wouldn’t be able to do once I’m back home as the drinking age is higher back home. I realized that it made me think clearer like before I just felt like my days became foggy, I couldn’t focus, I was slow like physically constantly and I felt like I couldn’t recall a single thing I was doing. With alcohol, I feel like I’m able to sob like able to feel my emotions and it’s made me realize how set I am on my idea that life is pointless. I am aware that it makes me feel more suicidal but no worries about that atmas I am living with my friend, I could not leave her with dealing with my death head on but that is also a reason for worry about going back home as I wouldn’t have a reason to stay alive. 

I feel like I don’t even feel drunk on alcohol. I just feel clearer. Like things make sense as in it’s all so pointless. Btw this haven been a long term issue, It has been 3 days in a row of a full bottle of wine. the 3rd day as in being rn i’ve actually had 1 1/2 instead of 1 bottle but I will likely finish the rest.",0.115,0.166,0.719
depression,Loss of interest,"I have no motivation anymore. I’ve been back on my citalopram for about a month or so (I go off and on constantly…).

I use to have that desire when I was little.

I use to play the piano, play sports (basketball and soccer were my favorite), I knew what I wanted to be when I grew up, I never gave up when I failed at something, I had friends. I just wish I knew that significant moment in my life that changed everything, but I can’t…maybe there wasn’t a moment and I was just doomed to be depressed since it runs in my family. 

Just wish I wasn’t feeling down, and such a disappointment cause I don’t know what to do with myself, I’m tired of feeling jealous of my younger brother cause he figured it all out, wish I knew what I wanted to do with my life…instead of just sitting inside all day.

This was a post I’d made 2 years ago, can’t believe it’s already been 2 years. I’m writing this post for anyone who is in a similar state to tell them that hanging on eventually does get better, but not without you taking some serious actions. 

I was in a dark place because I was attached to my ex (had issues with body image and got addicted to the validation from the the one girl that I got into a relationship with, and couldn’t let go even after all the toxicity and abuse because I felt I couldn’t get another girl ever in my life). 

While the relationship had soured towards the end and I was convinced of ending it, it still took a bit of courage to do it. I was starting with a job right after graduation and that gave the final push for me to end it, as I’d realised I couldn’t work devotedly with the frequent shananigans of the ex. 

I’ve gotten over another friendship too that I used to think I was dependent on, there was an incident where something was said verbally which broke me to the core and made me lose all feelings towards humans and my trust in humans (in the emotional context). I’ve moved on from the past and that’s given me a lot of headspace to think clearly, whereas earlier I’d just be in a constant state of worry about this friend. 

Right now I’ve quit the job too and have started working with a few partners on interesting projects with significant scale (while I’d always dreamed of doing big things, there never was a clarity in how to achieve it). Life is going well so far, let’s see what the future holds. 

To anyone who’s been beaten down by life, pick yourself up and put your pieces back together, it’ll take time and a ton of mental effort. You’ll always have these scars and there will be times when you’ll get flashbacks, but eventually it does get better, just keep moving ahead, one step at a time. And remember, to make room for new connections, let go of the old ones, specially the ones that gave you trauma.

depression,The Form of Depression,"If depression could take a physical form I don't think it would be one thing.

I think it would be water that never dries up and fills the room slowly and methodically while you look for a way out (there isn't one). I think it would be a statue that you see everywhere but it makes you feel nothing to look at it. Depression would be a christmas morning with no presents under the tree, even from yourself. 

Sleeping for a long time, waking up, and not knowing what time or day it was, only that it is nighttime and everyone else is asleep so you have no one to ask. For some its a raging river sweeping them under. For others its a clock ticking down that they're constantly forced to look at. 

For me its a box that I have tried desperately to escape for years, but nothing seems to work. The walls are made of concrete and every chip in it just leads to more concrete. There's a tiny little hole where sunshine sometimes peeks through, but its only enough to taunt me, not warm me up or light up the room.

Got out due to medical reasons and im currently not physically able to work a blue colllar job anymore.  So I started a business and failed. I understand its good to fail bcz you learn from them but subconsciously it made me break down myself as a man even more. My car is paid off, i have a great gf, a great german shepherd, nice apartment, in college, etc. But everything in my life I see as an achievement doesnt up lift me to feel better. I dont think im a great man for being a veteran, I think im a bad man for basically not fulfilling my life by being a soldier/man still and after having a failed business, the absence of a father my whole life (almost), 50k plus in credit card debt and many more excuses that dont fucking matter. I just feel im in a loop of constant worry. I’ve been working out consistently which cured me from excessive depression (but im not proud of that bcz im to busy thinking about my stressors still). 

Everyday i tell myself to speak with a counselor but everyday theirs a louder voice in my head that tells me don’t. Thats another problem I face. Sometimes I hear the subconscious voice in my head and its just as loud as my conscious mind, so I choose the option thats sounds the best. Wether thats smoking all day, not going to a counselor, letting my social anxiety keep me inside all week (besides the gym), being a coward towards my credit card debt, etc. Maybe I know im suppose to be better and thats why im trying to figure it out.

depression,I'm miserable,"I'm not a very good person, but I think I try to be. I grew up unstable, with a lot of mental/emotional manipulation and abuse, but never physical abuse. I was thoroughly brainwashed to the extent I believed a lot of the ways I was treated were deserved and more.  I didn't know how to express myself, which drove a strange combination of anger issues and hypersexuality (from the age of 4). Every attempt through my youth at developing confidence or independence was crushed. At 17, I hid in a toxic relationship, in which my confusion and lack of ability to stand up for myself led to my virginity being taken without my consent. I stayed for years after that; that relationship was my safe space from my parent and twisted me up even more. I became abusive and toxic, which fully manifested in my next relationship. I ended it when I couldn't stop myself from being a monster.

When I left home and finally started waking up to all of it, I realized what a mess I am. I don't know who I am. I don't know what I like. I don't have friends. I'm not close with my family. I try to be likeable, which for some reason is just being an asshole or letting people drain all the energy I have in me. I'm there for as many people as I know need someone. I try really hard to be, but it always reminds me that no one reciprocates. But it's selfish to expect someone to care just because I do, so I try really hard to shove back that feeling. I know being there for people makes a difference for them, so I keep trying. I'm trying to be there for me too. I wish anyone else wanted to be there for me. I try being there for my parents too. I can't be mad or hold them accountable. They were treated terribly by their own parents. I can't protect younger me from the way they treated me, but no one protected them either. At least I can recognize things now and try being there for everyone.

I try to counter all of the awful feelings I have about myself, but MAN do I make that hard to do. I say and do a lot of stupid things. I half-ass just about everything I do, and I don't think I really get joy out of anything. There's nothing I'm living for, but I don't think I truly want to kill myself. I just wish my life was different. I don't have any goals, but I work to not lose my job and am currently pursuing a Master's degree. Why? I don't know; they just seem like things I'm supposed to do. I keep my house clean, I take care of things I'm supposed to take care of, but again...why? I don't know why I do anything. I don't know why I keep forcing myself forward.

I've tried therapy, psychiatrists, counselors but ultimately I'm just a shell of what I think could have been a very ambitious person. I'm broken and every time I make some attempt at pulling it all together and figuring out who I am it all falls apart and I remember that there is no reason for me to be. I'm in a constant state of high stress and panic.

I'm 26 now, and a worthless waste of space. There's a constant dialogue running through my head, an argument, ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""No, you're not."" I don't think suicide is selfish. At least, in my case I don't think so. It's not like people would notice. Maybe they'd be sad for a bit, the ones I'm there for, but they'd get over it. The big thing with doing it is that I wouldn't have to deal with myself anymore. I can't stand me. I don't know if it's still the brainwashed part of me that can't stand the broken part or what, but I really hate myself. I can't stop thinking about the shitty things I do and have done to people. I can't let go of anything.

More than hating myself, I hate all the things I missed growing up. I hate that I didn't get to develop as a person with self-confidence, who knows what they want. I hate that I'll never know what unconditional love feels like - the kind people usually get from a parent. I hate that I've been dragging myself along all this time, making myself try so hard, for nothing. I kept telling myself one day I'll have kids and all this work I've put in will pay off because *they'll* have someone who protects their growth and loves them. I have no one to have kids with, no prospects, and am so isolated I've actually only thought about having and raising kids on my own. Alone. Always alone. What kind of a role model is that for them? I'm trying not to be someone who only exists when other peoples' eyes are on them though. I try not to care about external validation. I try to keep myself running, even when no one cares but me that I'm alive and doing my best.

I'm garbage. Every day my control slips more and more. I struggle with hypersexuality and can't get help. I don't want anything to happen with my job just because pleasure is a coping mechanism of mine. I got an opportunity to move, and I really need it. Maybe after I move. But I struggle to study, work, talk to people, anything really - it's affecting more and more and it makes me so miserable. I get so angry thinking maybe I wouldn't have been this way if only I'd been raised different that I fall into binges. I don't know why it's getting worse, but dying would resolve that too. 

I don't want to kill myself. I'm just so sick of this life. I'm ungrateful, I guess. Other people would definitely be happy to be where I am, but I'm not. I'm empty. I don't want to do it anymore - any of it. I don't know what I want though... I'm in a lot of pain. It manifests physically, just under my left collarbone. That's where my emotional pain lives. I don't know why. Sometimes it's so bad I break down, full on hyperventilating. I pull myself together and get back to whatever I've told myself I need to do. I don't need to do anything really though. I don't think I want to anymore. I can turn it all off - my emotions - but that makes me feel crazy. We're supposed to let ourselves feel then be done with it, right? But it doesn't end.

Venting all of this openly to strangers on the internet makes sense right now because I was sitting here doing homework, came across this thread, and saw how people were sharing. It seemed nice. I think maybe something that could help is if anyone out there has ideas or suggestions on things to make someone feel like a person? Or real things to live for/look forward to? 

Maybe it would be nice to disappear. ",0.112,0.206,0.682

depression,I can't take therapy seriously since my ex girlfriend's therapist told her to broke with me.,"Hello everyone.
I'm gonna be quick. 

 I've been in therapy since September  (last year), I take 2 sessions per month and recently, my actual therapist made me realize that my ex girlfriend therapist adviced her to broke with me. 
This makes me really think if therapy is a real good thing, since she broke up with me I've had issues with my mental health (depression, anxiety, low self esteem and downgrade in my physical health in general).
She was my first girlfriend (I'm 29) and we NEVER EVER had any toxic behavior, there was no reason at all from her therapist to advice her leaving me, i don't drink, I don't consume any drugs or weed, i don't even see girls on social media or had any micro cheating, all what I did wrong was telling her how bad I felt about my  appearance or the stress that my workload caused. (This happened like only 2 times per month).

I'm pretty sure she cheated on me and that destroys me, it made me feel like a piece of trash and that I'm not enough, even if I'm a good guy, what's the point of being back to therapy if absolutely no one is going to valuate my process and my efforts?

I always feel that there is something  I didn’t study and on test day, that feeling stresses me more to the degree where I have to pee 2 times before and once the exam starts.

Reason am writing this is because I was taking a look at other people’s marks of the same exam am taking and for some reason I cried. I cried because I do study alot but haven’t achieved dream score even after taking some exams multiple times. Its tough when I aim to the stars and stay stuck in the clouds. ",0.101,0.118,0.78

i scratched myself with a knife last week to the point it bled for the first time, it felt so good and i’m so mad at myself for doing it. my mother caught me, she was supportive but then she wasn’t. i cut myself the other day with those razor blades from a shaver, i told my mom about it because she already knew i harmed myself and she asked if i was brain dead and couldn’t control myself. i don’t know what to do, the urge is too strong? i feel like i want to kill myself? i feel so unattractive and everything in the negatives, i feel that i’m not the kid that my parents deserved to get. im crying myself to sleep very often and it sucks so much

i’m supposed to get help in another 9? weeks from my countries help in teenagers. i feel utterly useless because my mom reminded me that “cutting yourself won’t make you get help quicker”

depression,Thank you ,"Im so grateful to this little brave girl for all she has done for me. I know she struggled so much, but she is the reason I am who I am. She was scared and broken by all this injustice in her life. She saw these kids, who were going to play outside together after school, but realised, that she can't be a part of their group. She had a lot of things to do, such as visit a judo class, a music school, some extra english lessons and a lot of her homework. All in one day. And the next day will be the same as a previous one, next week too. All she ever wanted was recognition. But she never was enough.

I can't blame her for my zero communication skills. She had no idea that this was a thing, she didn't want it, did't think that she need it. I have no right to judge her for ending up locking herself at home because, as a result of her decisions, she couldn't fit in anywhere. She is tired. She doesn't wand to participate in any competitions. She has no strength or desire to try to move forward. She is exausted of being not enough. So am I.

Im able to do a lot of things thanks to her. Even though I havent trained for a couple of years, I still I remember several judo techniques, so I’m not afraid for myself. I can play several instruments (4 to be clear). I know how to write a poem, a book, even a musical piece. I graduated from school with honors, not afraid of perfoming in front of an audience. But also thanks to her I can't talk with people. This little girl never had friends. She ended up in her room, realising, that she skipped the whole part of maturing. She wasnt there when her peers started dating eachother, she wasnt there when they were inviting her to the parties. She thought parties were stupid, because they won't make people respect you. She had things to do. She didnt really wanted all of her skills tho. The only thing she craved was to stop it all. All this endless learning. Just be a normal kid, normal teenager. But she was too smart not to understand that she will never become one.

This little girl was forced to learn how to lie and please people, so she can have a piece of her well-decerved freedom. Now, of course, if she has a reason, she can go anywhere and please anyone, because she knows how to do it. But she will never understand, how to be really friendly. To visit a party not because she needs to, just because she want.  To play the piano in front of a huge hall of people because she wants to and like to do it, and not because she has to. She doesn't know what it is to want to do something. She doesn't want to do anything. She's already done too much. So am I.",0.135,0.093,0.771
depression,L'appel du vide,"""The call of the void"". This phrase has always stuck with me, because it describes it like no other can. I have been struggling with depression since I was around 10 years old. I recall the timeline of my life by my mood or suicidal periods. And I am just starting to dig out of one of the worst holes I've been in.

I feel so limited in discussing the stressors I face professionally, as I work in healthcare and there is such a stigma to mental health with this career. I can say that I am overworked and overstressed. My mood has suffered greatly. I am on a cocktail of meds which generally help, but sometimes aren't enough. After having to switch psychologists a few years ago, I haven't found a new one that I can form a constructive relationship with. 

While I am starting to feel some little hope again, I am terrified because I was the closest I think I've ever been to suicide. And I've been close before. I lost a friend to suicide 3 years ago and I know the devastation that brings. I know I'd never want my husband to go through what I did. But my pain was so unbearable that I found myself slipping down the mountain to the cliff's edge anyways. I made a will and durable POA, even got it all officially notarized. I made copies and placed them in multiple secure places. Given my profession, I have a lot of skills and the knowledge to know how I would want to do it. I thought about this constantly. Since getting a real adult job, I have taken out extensive life insurance and accident policies to ensure my husband's ability to survive financially if anything happened to me. Given the recent struggles, I looked up the policies. Most life insurance policies have a suicide clause for the first 1-3 years. Meaning if you die by suicide in the first few years it won't pay out, but if it occurs after that period, your loved one will receive a pay out. This tends to be true for most private and employee based insurances. However, my employee policies would never pay off for suicide-related death, regardless of how lony after the plan was purchased. My husband would be left with very little. 

And so I decided to live. 

Fortunately I had requested a vacation a long time ago, so I've had the last week off. I am feeling less utter despair. I hope it lasts and is just my mood improving. I worry it's simply the result of having time to relax, sleep, spend time with loved ones, etc and as such will dissipate on my return to work. I suppose the fear I have is a sign that I am getting better enough to know suicide isn't the answer... ?",0.104,0.182,0.714
depression,Lost all ability to feel emotion,"This started in 2021 when I lost a family member, I remember crying for many days as it was massively traumatic to me, but I was told by another member of my family that I needed to keep it together and stop crying, so to not upset them with my distress I held it in. Well a couple of months had passed and I started getting quite ill, it started with a massive increase in my resting heart rate, I went to the doctor and they told me my heart rate was 180bpm, I had to get an ecg done and it was determined that it was due to extreme anxiety and nothing to do with my actual heart, that news relieved me and I remember crying from relief but also from how overwhelming the whole situation felt. Then a month later I got a really bad stomach bug and i couldn't eat for days, but after that passed I just felt numb and that numbness has followed me until this very day, I just feel empty, I watch videos that would in the past make me laugh, and now I just sit and watch them stonefaced.

Like there's nothing inside me. And that hurts me I don't remember what it was like to feel normal, I never did. I don’t think I've ever felt normal.

No matter how much I try to change and grow, I watch videos, I go to therapy, I write, I take medication. I still struggle with it. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't know why it isn't working I struggle to feel anything at all. And when I do feel, it's only negative. Only pain.

 I know everyone feels like way but, like most people, I'm just here to vent out this sadness in me.

But recently, the last couple months, I've just felt empty. Can't feel any happiness no matter what I do, what activities I do with my friends, time spent with family, calls made to friends on the other side of the world. Its hard to describe.

depression,Dating while depressed?,"TLDR: Life long depression, fibromyalgia, anxiety; do I deserve love/to date?

I have treatment resistant dysthymia that I’ve had most of my preteen and onward life, been trying therapy/meds/other stuff for the past 10 years to which not much has helped. I suffer symptoms of depression and my anxiety, like low self esteem, low mood, pessimism when it’s really bad, worrying, exhaustion. More so between October-may ish because seasonal affective disorder as well. It does make it difficult to be super affectionate and loving and attentive (not quite my personality to be like that as I never grew up with that), especially if someone doesn’t put in effort or doesn’t put effort in unless I do. 

I’ve had several relationships, some local some long distance, but I feel like I always get boring for them unless I’m constantly fun and providing dopamine for them, and they end up leaving. 

My depression and anxiety makes things difficult but I do know that someone with more secure attachment that can consistently show me love and security helps me bloom as well and be more able to provide things In return. 

I just got out of a year+ long, long distance relationship because they said I wasn’t fun and was just making them depressed because in winter all I have energy to do is cuddle and watch movies, go out to eat or to a movie sometimes and have good conversations. They ended up just spending all their time with friends and not me. 

So now I’m second guessing if I should just be alone forever because no one can love me and not be bothered when I’m depressed. On the other having someone is helpful to me. It gives me company that provides love which is really helpful when I’m more depressed, helps me feel safe and secure, and when someone “cares” for me IE doing things for me, showing me a lot of love and importance and whatnot, helps with things I struggle with with bad episodes, helps a lot. Although, in my prior relationship they said they felt they can’t make me happy and have been trying to give everything to me to fix me and my issues and can’t do it anymore. (I never asked them to fix anything, I just wanted someone to love me and hold my hand while I go through life trying to feel better). 

I just don’t know anymore. I feel like I deserve love, someone who truly loves me and helps makes things easier for me and holds my hand and helps me heal past trauma and have a better, more fulfilling life together. A support system. But after this last relationship I just also feel like I don’t deserve love, because I have struggles and the thought of having to go most of my life alone just sucks.

depression,"I hate group conversations/chats. Eventually I realize no one's listening and no one finds me entertaining or funny enough, so I give up and leave.

I have big goals and definitely am terrible at handling jokes, and because of my traumatic experiences in the past worry if I'm ever the one someone's laughing at, because I dont know how to talk to them back. It scares the living shit out of me to be honest, being laughed at or feeling like I'm put to a corner or feel like I'm being taken advantage of cause I couldn't get the joke.

This has gone to a point where I give up and leave a group chat, and I break down crying and wanna end my life and start having suicidal thoughts.

I'm genuinely happier on my own, but being human I find myself craving human interaction, and with it definitely validation. I get the classic ""you don't need to rely on people to validate you"" but honestly that's basically synonymous with saying don't expect anything when talking to people. And the whole point of talking to people is that we feel a connection with someone, is it so wrong that that comes with basic harmless expectations?

On one hand, I can't crack a funny joke, the only thing people seem to listen to is if I give a new fact or say something deeply thought-provoking that I've thought of a ton of times and revised before saying it out loud. On the other hand, if someone does banter/say something humorous back, and THAT'S found funny, then I feel stumped and silenced.

Usually I'll imagine some of the most beautiful conversations in my mind, and visualize them playing out as a story or something.

I know that I'm focused on my goals, but at the same time I have to be able to converse and actually be able to flow well with someone and be humorous.

I was on lexapro and then cymbalta for 4 months and 1 month respectively, and then quit, replacing it with supplements and plants like Kanna 5htp CBD and many others. They worked like a charm for a month and a half and my mood was an average of 7 out of 10. A bad day was a 6 but ofen I was in a pretty cheerful mood. Then last Sunday I was severely sleep deprived (went to bed at 4 but eyes snapped open at 6:30) and went to a party later in the day and had 5 and a half beers total over a period of 8 hours. I normally limit myself to no more than 3 but after the first three wore off I had a few more because I rarely go to parties. Also for context I only drink once or twice a week with friends so that's not really an issue. I didn't feel close to drunk or intoxicated so I thought it was fine.

Is the entirety of adult life just coping or is that just the people like me. I couldn't imagine growing old and feeling this way.

Some people say they love life and are rarely depressed. The last time I felt thay way I was a child. I haven't felt like that for at least 7 years. I really do think I'm screwed. When you have depression for a while it really becomes painful. The anxiety too. I don't function like a healthy person. I'm always tired. Even when I'm thinking of nothing. I feel empty. I think much of it comes from childhood neglect. I don't think I'll ever feel safe or loved. I don't even know what it feels like. Being  around people gives me anxiety. 

When I try to be a normal person with healthy habits. I have mental breakdowns. Doing anything consistently even eating or sleeping normally is so tiring. If I do one productive thing, I'm drained. I feel nauseous often lately.

I don't know what it feels like to want anything. If I could sleep forever I would. 

I wonder how many people feel this way. I must sound insane to most.",0.161,0.187,0.652
depression,I'm worried about my mum,"Hello,

For context, I'm French and I (F24) live in France.
My mum is severely depressed because of an awful list of traumas. Her family story is very dark. She's 63 and she was always depressed during my childhood and teenage years, but I think we hit rock bottom right now. 
She has recurring panic attacks, she cries all the time and I know she wants to kill herself but she doesn't only because I'm here.
She doesn't want to take antidepressants anymore (she says it makes her vomit). Or anxiolytics. She doesn't want to be hospitalized (it's a trigger because a member of her family who abused her was hospitalized, so she kind of linked the two if that makes sense). My father has no empathy, he doesn't help her, he even victimizes himself and fakes depression with meds and all. He told disgusting things about her to our doctor and now she can't see her anymore.

So my mum is basically trapped at home 
because she's too tired to escape. She's in denial about my dad and completely desperate. I have to travel a lot for my job so I can't be there with her. 
I don't know what to do. She has to be taken care of somewhere otherwise I fear the worst. 
If anyone can help me, or at least talk to me, it would be appreciated.

Thank you

depression,How do I cope? (24F),"I (24F) have recently had a bad spell of depression since September. I went to go stay at my aunts house to get out of the house and a change of scenery.

I’ve suggested a maid, but they don’t want anything “stolen” as if our house isn’t filthy enough. It just makes me feel dirty, being in the house. I want to get a job and start my life, but I feel like I can’t with the house and every time I express how I feel, I’m ungrateful. And I apparently have it nicer than a lot of people. We’ve never lived like this. I wish I could show pictures, but I don’t want to humiliate my mom. She’s burnt out and I feel for her, but this has affected my mental health. Any suggestions?

depression,I hate my life,"Ever had the feeling that your mind is broken? Beyond repair? Not even God can mend the damages it has? That’s me. Sorry to cluster my feelings onto a page (probably no one going to read it) but I need to get this out of my chest. I think I’m on the verge of a never ending depression and I won’t be able to survive this episode. 
Usually when I’m depressed there is usually one thing that triggers it. Now I don’t know what is. Probably buried feelings that I’m holding in. I have a girlfriend in which I love. When I was younger I thought I wouldn’t be able to date anyone. My dad’s  an asshole who left my mother and father 16 other kids while leaving them as well. My mother was somewhat abusive (verbally and physically) but thank god for arthritis slowing her down. (Jokes). Now she no longer acts like a mother but an annoying older sibling that thinks they have authority but in actuality can’t function properly. She makes it so hard to be her son. She makes it hard to want to be alive. My mom and dad’s relationship made me think that I was incapable of love but I got my girlfriend for the first time. 
From the beginning of our relationship she made it clear that she would be able to keep it long term. She’s a church girl with a lot of responsibilities among school and to her church. Her parents are strict and breathe over neck several times despite her being a very smart and capable girl to make her own decisions. (Tbf I can’t judge their parenting style since my mother is ok with whatever u do. Thank god I’m not a dumbass). As the relationship developed we gotten WAY to attached and I am in love with her deeply. I can’t see myself without her in any other role. Yesterday it hit me that she will end whenever she pleases. She does her best to show that she loves and cares for me but it isn’t enough to stay i guess. Once that thought came to mind I saw that was probably how my father thought. Maybe he did care for my mother but wasn’t capable of staying with her and the children they procreated. I don’t want her to leave me. And if she does, I don’t know what I’ll do. I can’t see my life without her.
They say time heals all wounds but I still trying to mend my health from the damages my father and mother have inflicted on me. They’re nowhere near from mended nor will be. Will therapy help? Probably not bc I won’t be willing to open myself up. This depression has my abandonment issue on a frenzy in which I don’t know what to do. Should I just end it with my gf? The only girl who’s shown interest in me. I’m an ugly motherfucker so I won’t be on anyone else’s radar. Or should I just take the time I have with her until she decides to leave me? I hate to be abandoned. I hate having people leave my life. And I hate how dependent I am on these aspects of life.

depression,Fear of losing the most amazing girlfriend in the world :(,"Hello everyone.  
I have girlfriend approximate 2 years. She is the most amazing, intelligent, kind and lovely person in the world. She means the world to me. We had an amazing and beautiful relationship, experiences, travelling, she has great parents with whom I get along incredibly great. Just 3 months ago, I was the luckiest person in the world. 

We're both in our final year of university, so that included some stress at home. At the beginning of February, I quit my job at a bank so that I could concentrate on my final exams and master's thesis. In order to tighten the household financially, I wanted to find and work a part-time job temporarily. But exactly 3 months ago at this point of my/our life/live, out of nowhere, a huge change occurred in my life.

 I've struggled with low self-esteem all my life, been a procrastinator, and had periods (especially before I found a girlfriend) when I felt mild bouts of sadness. But it was never anything terrible, I knew how to function like that in life. But at this time in my life, anxiety, depression, procrastination, self-doubt have hit me so hard that I am unable to function absolutely. It's as if I've become a completely different person overnight and I can't rationally explain what actually happened. 

Most likely, I do not have a chance to graduate successfully this academic year. I haven't found a part-time job yet. I haven't even filed my tax return more than a month after the deadline and many other small tasks. I am not able to go grocery shopping, go for a walk, even postpone contacting my professors, I have completely stopped communicating with family and friends. I feel terrible. I am an ordinary loser and a failure. My self-esteem is at a freezing point. I feel like an inferior fool. I have no motivation. I stopped perceiving my future prospects very positively, while 3 months ago I had a comfortable job and life. I have an IQ of 138, but I'm not even able to finish college. For the past 3 months, I have felt nothing but sadness and anxiety. A sadness that hurts so much that I can't handle it anymore. Sometimes it happens to me that during a big rush of anxiety, I seem to disconnect from my body. I look at myself in the mirror and I don't even know who I see in that mirror anymore. I'm just asking myself, what TF happened to me?

 I try to fight it, but every morning when I finally manage to get up and tell myself that today will be a better day and I will study for exams, it lasts like 30 minutes. Then I fall into a routine again of playing chess for the whole day (literally 8am to 4am). Sometimes I go even 30 hours without sleep. Chess is actually  Back to top. My girlfriend is the last or only thing in the world that keeps me alive. But the last few weeks have been really terrible and I felt like we were moving away from each other. Inexplicably, I push her away, ignore her. When we're not together, I just roar like a little kid that I don't deserve such a wonderful girlfriend and maybe I should leave her. Currently, she left for 2 weeks to see her family and gave me time to get myself together. But it just can't be done. It is clear to me that I need help, but I cannot afford it financially. My life hangs on the verge and I'm just a short way from completely breaking down and losing myself. To clarify, I don't have suicidal tendencies yet, although I do occasionally work with the idea. But I wouldn't be able to kill myself never in my life because I can't even imagine the tremendous pain I would inflict on my family, my girlfriend, and her family. I just needed to get all this shit out of myself.

depression,Having a relapse is never fun ,"So it’s been almost a year since I started taking antidepressants and at about the same time I had to stop with group therapy because I moved. May last year I was crying on a daily basis and I had no hope for life. I was suicidal and at the start of June and had to go to the ER because my thoughts and excessive crying were getting out of hand. After I started taking the antidepressants honestly I don’t know how I felt an immediate effect (probably placebo). The crying stopped and little by little my confidence was getting better. I moved to a new city, started with a new job. Things were not great - like there were many failed love stories and things with my supervisor at work were (and still are) challenging. But somehow I was holding up and pushing through quite well. 

However, now I am having a proper relapse. This week I’ve cried 4 different days. And just now I couldn’t resist and self harmed. Once again I keep on thinking oblivion is my only salvation. I know I won’t do anything to myself, but gotta admit I am scared of having a full blown relapse and I honestly don’t know what’s my best course of action. I live in Germany and I am not a German speaker so getting to therapy here is going to be super hard and it will likely take months till I get a spot. 

What frustrates me the most is that honestly I didn’t think I will be back to square one so soon and for the pettiest of reasons ever. Like how am I supposed to live a fulfilling life if these relapses keep on coming like that? Does anyone else ever feel this? This just makes me hate myself even more and think that I’ll never be loved and accepted by others. ",0.127,0.153,0.72

depression,I tried to kill myself 3 times the last month because of her. She definitely doesn't care. I need to get over it somehow.,"My ex and I were together almost 3 years. During that time, she was very flirtatious with everyone, including the many people who kept flirting back. When I mentioned how it made me feel disrespected she would say that she understood why, then did nothing about it.

She then broke up with me over text. We hooked up a couple more times and she said that she wasn't interested in anyone, still found me attractive, and broke up because of compatibility issues. While this was happening, the vast majority of my friends were telling me how they were interested in her the whole time.

Then, she told me she wasn't attracted to me anymore because when I would point out the way she broke up with me was pretty emotionless and cruel it made her feel guilty. She then told me she lied to me and was interested in a guy that I explicitly asked if she was interested in. She then started dating him less than 2 months after ending our relationship.

The fact she moved on so quickly and flirted with people the whole time made me realize she didn't care about or respect me at all, while I had strong love and care for her. I also now have basically no friends left. I feel so pathetic and unloveable/unlikeable and don't feel like going on.

So, I downed a bunch of alcohol and went to finish off my painkillers, only to find out I was nearly completely out of painkillers and passing out. The next morning I went to get more, but, I had started drinking before. So, I decided to try and die in a drunk car crash. But, literally everywhere I was driving had casualties if I crashed and I couldn't keep driving straight, so I went home. A couple weeks later I tried the alcohol and pain killers again, but drank too much and threw up most of the pills, spending the rest of the night in cold sweats shivering on my bathroom floor before passing out.

depression,It s something that I can t explain..,"I genuinely believe I have a good life. I have a familly that supports me , cheer for me and is there for me . Let’s start with beggining:
- I was a top child in my hometown with above average IQ (137 , yes I was tested) , I was the best at everything , best in my class , getting medals in school competitions .
- I practiced tennis , I excelled there as well ,I don t want to sound narcissistic but this was the reality . I was best in my town  at the 10yo age group . Won several medals and trophies there 
-I had a lot of friends , kinda popular and never felt alone.
-Despite other children my hobbies were  solving rubik cubes and read , probably read like 200 or 300 books in less than 3 years 

And then , everything changed. From the 6th grade , everything ruined apart, the problem is I don’t know why.

My grades slowly decreased . I stopped playing tennis and started playing video games . I centerer my life into my room and my computer . Also something strange happened to me as well. I started lying . A lot of lying , even small things I was lying and I was never get caught . I created imaginary friend that my mom genuinely believed I was friend with in real life and made up stories that I even believed them at some point. For example I was coming from school and started to narrate things to mom , only things that I made up to entertain her(like a friend doing something stupid at school ,u get it). And somehow I knew every detail and every small thing about lies , it was like it was my life. I m doing this since 6th grade and now I m 18 and never got caught once about all this imaginary world I created. Sometimes I was going out just to back up my lies and spend time walking into a park. 

Since then , my grades were lower and lower , my interest was beyond normal levels , I was just not interested in anything. I discovered p*rnography which was also an important factor in ruining my life . Hours and hours on those sites drained my soul . I tried finding escape in motivational videos and stop complaining myself and take action ,but also I just can t keep a habit , I started doing 100 pushups a day and after 6 days I stopped and get back to my old habits. I tried to get rid of p*rnography for over 3 years and I still can t . 

Now , I m 18 , never had a girlfriend , 3 friends(classmates ) they are my only friends but we are not close , just hang out at school and than we never met outside of it . After graduation they surely won t contact me or anything , I m just there with them and they enjoy my presence I guess. So I can say 0 friends, no girlfriend, never drank alchool,never getting dr*gs ,just me , existing.
 
*HERE* is the problem .My lies backed up my life so good that everyone believe I m a cool guy. Not cool but like normal and stuff which I m not.My mom always tells me how I managed to make our family so happy and unite . I am always giving out advices which people will benefit from most of the time . All think , I am ok , but I m not . I m struggling , I can t even get up from bed , I can t study anymore ,I always feel empty , like a hole in my chest which will never be fulfilled . But I m too good at lying ,  always I put a smiley face when talking to my parents , always suggest them to go out to a walk and enjoy life .But I am teared apart , I don t know how much I can do this anymore .My only happiness at the moment which make me forget about my life are movies and series . I feel like when I m watching the TV my thoughts are not controlling anymore .

depression,I think my partner finally got tired of my depression,"sharing this here because I’ve got no one to talk to about this.

nobody really talks about being in a perfectly okay relationship while dealing with depression. my boyfriend makes me happy, some of my best days were def spent with him. but most of the time, the happiness can’t last. plus I don’t really mean to ask too many favors from him, but there are days when my depression gets the best of me and I cannot physically move. I study in a quite demanding university and so as not to miss any of those demands (or else I could fail) during my worst episodes, I would need a little push or even help to physically get to places. he would sometimes volunteer to bring me meals and comfort me when worse comes to worst. unsurprisingly, there are days when he would get tired of doing all these altogether.

just yesterday, we’ve reached a point in our relationship where he’s asking for an indefinite break from us. he says I’ve been depressed for months (which surprised me because I thought I’ve seen better days in the past few months) and he’s just tired of it so he needs a break. I’m so devastated but who am I to refuse him that break, right? it just sucks because the last thing I want is to have my depression as the primary cause of our fallout. I really love him still.

In January of this year everything felt like it was finally going my way. I had a good job, I’d just got my first car at the end of 2023 and I’d just paid first months rent on my first apartment with my roommate. Then out of nowhere after knowing I’d just started renting someplace out, my boss let me go with no warning. I wasn’t fired, he claimed he couldn’t make payroll, but still kept the employee that I helped get a job there, and that had been there for much less time than me. This alone was stressful enough but to top it all off as I was moving my things out of my family’s house, my uncle had an aggressive episode and attacked me. I did nothing to provoke him and just wanted to leave but he held me down and physically restrained me while my mom was out at the car and couldn’t hear. I wish I could say there was more to the story but I still don’t know what snapped in him. All I know is I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He’s much bigger and stronger than me and I’ve never felt so scared and helpless before. I told my grandma and she took his side which is much more heartbreaking than I can describe because up until now I really trusted the both of them, and would go to her when things were hard. Now everything is just shattered and I know there’s no going back to how I lived and viewed the world before. 

I’m jobless, pretty much friendless, and now I have this trauma that I don’t know what to do with. I want to talk to a professional but don’t know how I’m supposed to do that when I don’t have a job and can’t even muster up the energy to do simple tasks like go to the grocery store. I’ve always posted my thoughts and feelings for my few close friends and family to see on private accounts, but the older I get the more I realize that people don’t really care. It’s like they don’t even read what you have to say anymore. For the past few weeks I’ve just been playing Fallout 76 nonstop, and up until today Ive felt pretty content.

One part of me wants to die another wants to live and make it thru this tough time but im so fucking tired of fighting. I just want to give up. This past year has been really rough for me. I keep hoping things will get better and I feel like im trying but I also feel like I’ve been living in limbo… like im here but not actually here.. idek why im writing in here but hopefully i feel better after getting this shit off my chest. I just never had it easy. And I know some people, shit probably most. Have it worse than I do but the life im living seems pretty fucking terrible for me. I became an alcoholic at 15. I think im a sex addict also, I had my fare share of doing drugs but never had a drug problem. Money is a big issue for me. Can’t keep a car, can’t keep a friend or boyfriend maybe im the problem I just feel like everyone comes around me and uses me and drains me when my life is ok then I end up back in this shitty state of mind and always have to pull myself out. And it’s so fucking hard tryna take care of yourself plus three kids I don’t even feel like my kids love me. I mean I know they do but I just can feel the disconnect between us. Im miserable. I hate my appearance I feel ugly, as fuck tbh I don’t even take care of myself anymore. I don’t care too. I try but I still just feel disgusted with myself. but my kids are waking up so hope to chat soon.",0.144,0.228,0.629
depression,I fucking hate my life,"If me 2-3 years ago, could see where I am now he would probably cry. back then I had a girlfriend, a ton of friends, a job, and just a happy life.

Now I have nothing. None of my friends hit me up anymore, and my girl cheated on me. My mom OD’d on opiates and lives at some trailer park hours away, crippled for life. My dad works seven days a week, and I never get to see him. I’m having so much trouble finding a job, and my “friends” poke fun at my unemployment. Every chance they get.

They’re all going to college and rooming together, and no one invited me. Do you know how painful it is to watch your friends ask people who you’re not nearly as close with to come room with them while you’re just sitting there watching? Just having to stay in your old hometown with no car and no friends?

And I just think back to just 2 years ago. I was in 10th grade, I had so many friends, I threw a party where 300+ people showed up, I really loved my girlfriend and my mom was normal. Everything was perfect. Now I am so alone and honestly, if it wasn’t for my siblings or my dad, I would kill myself. 

I just don’t know what to do. Every single day feels like Sunday and I feel like I could win the lottery or something and I still would not feel anything. It’s the last month of school. Senior year. This is supposed to be fun, prom, beach days, etc. Except I have nothing.

depression,I was rejected at university but I want to get over it and be happy again,"I feel so pathetic for even typing this. This will be a HEAVILY abridged version of events as it would be too long to type, though I may update this post to add context created by comments asking questions/giving advice, so feel free!

I started university 2 years ago and quickly entered a ""friendship"" group. I thought we got along okay, though I later discovered that none of them really liked me. I was mostly friends with one person in particular, let's call him Alex. We bonded fairly quickly since we both liked to check up on one another, seeing how they're feeling, family life, supporting one another etc. but slowly they started to pull away from me and seemed to dislike being near me. This culminated in them texting me that we're not compatible as friends, but they don't mind talking to me in class. I was extremely heartbroken that someone I considered a friend seemed to not feel themselves around me, but what made it worse is that the rest of the group spent the summer together. I spent that summer feeling extremely rejected and when I came back, i just felt like the odd one out. They're all real friends and i'm just the guy everyone has to tolerate being around.

It got so bad that I had to leave university because of how depressed I was over the way the situation played out. I've described the full scenario to the university's safeguarding team, multiple therapies and my family and keep getting back the same feedback; ""these people sound awful"", ""i know it hurts"", ""you deserve better"", ""they sound extremely confusing"" etc etc. But it's been a year now and i'm still not over it.

I'm set to go back to university (a different one) in September, but i'm still extremely sad and have no idea what to do anymore. I know WHY i'm sad (a mixture of rejection, emotional neglect and them representing my neglectful parents) but I don't know how to get over it..? any advice will be helpful (and i'll provide more context)

TLDR; I was rejected at university, left and now I don't know how to get over it and be happy with my life.",0.146,0.159,0.696

I don't really sleep much (I tend to pull all nighters almost every night because if I stop playing to go to bed, I'll be left alone with my thoughts.

I can't afford therapy or anything, and I know my parents won't take me seriously, so I cant trust them with this. I want to do SOMETHING. Anything to make my life mean something, but it feels pointless. It feels meaningless. As it is, I'm just drifting and waiting to eventually die. And with my habits, it will probably come sooner than later. It really just feels like I've completely given up, and I don't feel like there's anything I can do about it. i mean, its not like i want to die or anything. im too much of a coward for that. i just cant bring myself to live right.

I was happy when he had a normal job, I was finally not miserable all the time and he goes and ruins it for me. He claims he gave me a choice, which sure on paper it was, but there's underlying issues to that because if I had said no I want you to stay at your real job then he would have been bitter and angry and distant and hopeless and depressed.

This is the second post concerning my depression that I am posting on reddit. 

I've had Tinder and other dating apps a few times. I never got any matches or likes. I then thought that Tinder and other dating apps determine my attractiveness. I then thought that my attractiveness determine my worth, likeablity, and success in all sectors of my life. 

I never also had a girlfriend while all men seem to have one. 

Reading about how ugliness determines my worth and how can I accept my ugliness on Quora made me extremely sick. It was so hard to read those stuff.

What should I do then? When I am very ugly? I am scared that I going to alone forever, no one will going to like me or find me attractive. I am also scared of failing in my life due to my ugliness. And it is so hard for me to accept that I am doomed in life.

depression,When you’re sad but have to be a husband. ,"Life is so unfair. 

I’m a 30yo male. I have a decent job on a farm. My wife works in retail. We have 4 children. We had 5. Cancer stole one from us and things have never been the same. When my son was diagnosed with a very rare brain cancer we were financially stable but after staying in the hospital for 9 weeks while waiting to find out what was going on, we pretty much lost it all. But we did our best to persevere while our sweet son fought this terrible illness. I continued to work hard and we actually bought our first home during his battle with cancer. In December of 2022 he lost his battle and things were so terrible. My wife didn’t leave her bed for over a month. I finally began seeing light in her eyes again in May of 2023. We took her mother in who was in recovery from addiction and for the first time in my wife’s life her mother was her best friend. Clean and sober. Then we came home from church on June 4th 2023 and found her mother dead in the same room her son took his last breath. Heart failure. My wife was distraught. Suicidal and refusing help. I have barely kept us afloat financially. Our circle is small so I’ve pretty much had to deal with everything on my own. While trying to hold my wife above the metaphorical river of life that was drowning her. We live in south Mississippi in the same house her son and mother passed away in and we know we want to get out. Drop everything. Our other children are homeschooled due to the immense amount of trauma they’ve endured. We are planning to move across the country at some point. Working paycheck to paycheck I don’t know how. We are going to try and sell our house. Maybe we’ll turn a profit. I took on a second job 3 nights a week and I donate plasma twice a week.

depression,"I am losing everything about myself, including my mind, literally.","I just had a mental breakdown and just need to say what’s on my mind, as it’s eating me alive, so please just listen. 

For some background, my entire life I have been quick thinking, one of the smartest in my grade, and overall pick up new concepts relatively easily. When I was 13 I got a concussion, and from sophomore year on I got 4 more, all in a span of 2.5 years. Since march 23rd, 2021 (the date of my first concussion in high school) I have had constant migraines of varying degrees. Sometimes I can’t even stand up, but I can deal with physical pain. For my entire life I have played competitive soccer, winning state championships and all that. After my second concussion, the one in March, I was barred from playing for a while and it really hurt me. It was at that point I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. They said that soccer was a way for me to cope, and without it, problems would arise. So obviously, once I was cleared to go back, I immediately did. Currently I have sustained 5 concussions from a variety of sources, and cannot play in college.

Here is the important part, I don’t just have chronic headaches. It’s not just that I have been in non stop pain for 3 years. No. My brain processing has gotten worse. I have always viewed my personal value as a human being based solely on my intelligence. Yet, I have noticed my thinking has slowed, I can’t memorize things as quickly, I forget words and events (recent and old memories), my vocabulary has deteriorated, my writing is worse, learning new concepts are extremely challenging (making me dread college as a major in Mechanical Engineering), and can’t multitask as well. This also translated into my classes and grades, where I would notice a quantifiable difference in my performance.

MRI scans have shown no permanent brain damage, and doctors say that my headaches will go away with lessened stress, but nothing has changed. One doctor got my hopes up with Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy, but that takes 20 hours a week at a hospital for 3 months straight. Not to mention that most neurologists view it as irrelevant and ineffective.

This year I took a gap year since I didn’t have time to apply my senior year of high school, and I just wonder, “Am I worth anything?” It is destroying me knowing that my potential is not what it was. I am not as smart as I was. How can I continue knowing that everything I want to do in life is impossible because I am literally too dumb?

I’ve been working remotely from home for about 5 yrs now.  It has gotten to my head. The loneliness. Lack of contact w people. Everything is a text message or email or document. I honestly just want to veg out for a while.  But I’m afraid if I do that, my skills will become ever worse. 

I picked a horrible career where you constantly have to be updating your skills and figuring out complex code. I no longer enjoy it and have no idea if I’ll ever work as a coder again. No idea who would hire me after this.  I’m not even good at what I do anymore. 

Honestly, I want to kill my self. I have plenty of money in the bank so I can survive for a year or more and do nothing. What upsets me is how others will perceive this.  “When did he become such an unemployed loser?”

I was always the smart one. The giving one. The people pleasing one. Now I feel like an idiot all the time

I can’t sleep because I’m in such a state of shock. Nothing can calm me down. I want to kill my self. 

I’m thinking if maybe driving Uber for a bit, but that doesn’t make any money.  I’m so depressed.  I don’t know how I got here. ",0.15,0.152,0.698

I think my being is struggling to exist in this realm. I struggle to be in this paradigm. I write, I write alot. I understand everything I see and do philosophically. So much that for me nothing makes sense anymore. I can't do my chores, go out or do stuff that everyone else does because for me this life is just a form of existing without meaning, just waiting to die. I suffer from depression since I know myself and I'm on meds and therapy but even my therapist struggles to help me cuz I'm so over my things that I always oppose to everything he says. I always have my answers and I block everyones opinion. But how do you cope with this kind of life we're in? How to try to live and do things without thinking how it all doesn't matter exactly.

A lot of psychiatrists and therapist I got through told me that I'm not curable. I'm a complex individual. They say that I just need to learn how to live with myself, depression and this existential crisis.

depression,Depression&Anxiety,"I am a (46F) and I have suffered with mental health issues from as far back as my teen and childhood years. Of course, back then, mental health issues were not spoken about like they are now plus the fact that my parents rarely took me to the doctor unless completely necessary and forget about seeing a shrink or therapist. Totally unheard of in my family. It’s unfortunate because I didn’t start seeing anyone until my adult years and by then, I was diagnosed with ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, PTSD, as well as Borderline Personality Disorder. My doctor put me on 6 different medications for all of my symptoms, mostly for my anxiety. I do take my anxiety medication but I haven’t taken my depression medication for years. I still pick them up from the pharmacy but refuse to take them because they never worked for me. I took them for years, to come to that conclusion. I have taken every anti depressant that there is out there and recently was made aware that some people have the MTHFR gene, which means that people are resistant against all these medications. After many many years of taking these medications, I have come to the conclusion that I may be one of 40 some odd percentage in the population that has this gene. I, of course, am not a doctor but I know my body pretty well. With the BPD, there is no medication that you can take for it. There is no cure. You basically suffer the rest of your life. I will say suffer too because it is hell. Pure torture! My mind does not work well and has not for as long as I can remember. If anyone has seen the story of Zoraya from the Netherlands, she was given the choice to end her life by euthanasia, due to her BPD and depression. I think about this daily and wish that we, in the United States, were given this same opportunity to have the choice to end our lives, especially going through this hell that I struggle with today. People who do not have these mental health issues cannot even begin to comprehend what it’s like to live with this, daily. I wish people would educate themselves more so that they do not judge people for their decisions to end their life, when people commit suicide. I wish wouldn’t judge people and say that they are a coward or that they took the easy way out, by ending their life. If only they knew the courage that it physically takes to keep going, when you are fighting so hard to want to live. Zoraya had a beautiful life. A loving boyfriend and even her favorite pet. Even with all the love in the world, it still can’t take away all the pain that we visibly can’t see. ",0.109,0.175,0.716

My name is Ethan, I am 15 years old and life has not been going too well.  My parents aren't together anymore, they separated when I was 2 but I still see both regularly.  My mom never really wanted to have a child.  She only had one because my grandma guilt-tripped her into it.  My mom when I was younger only spent about 5 minutes a day with me when she came back from work, this was usually to scream at me for doing something bad.  My dad on the other hand showed a lot of affection to me and I was with him all the time.  This made me like him more.  He was and still is an alcoholic, he is never physical but he just acts not like his usual self and does stupid things.  Fast forward to now, I have failed half of my Y10 exams, given up on my hobbies and have become a drone.  I don’t feel anything anymore.  I get in stupid fights with my mom.  I still have a good relationship with my dad but I'm scared that he is going to accidentally hurt himself if he keeps up all the drinking.  If that would happen “God Forbid” I would not have anything to live for.  He is my life and my world but as he increasingly drinks I can feel himself turning into another person.  I also have my faults.  I am lethargic, I can’t work for shit and I have the attention span of a goldfish.  My grades are falling and I’m not going to graduate.  I am obese and can't stop eating.  Life at school is not great, I do not feel like people care about me.  I have quite a bit of friends but I never seem to be someone's best friend or someone that they go to if they have problems.  Moving on to my grandma, she has publicly said that she wants to disown me to my mom.  This makes me feel sad but the bad thing is maybe she is right.  What am I here for, I do nothing and when I try I fail.  I don’t care about anything except food and music.  I crave my father back and some real compassion from my mom.  She’s just upstairs but in reality, she feels so distant.  Recently she had a baby with her partner and I see her be so compassionate to the baby.  I never got any of that, I literally have never hugged or barely touched my mom.  I throw myself at these distractions such as food but that just worsens my position.  I don’t know what to do and the thought of suicide has come into my head.  I’m not going to act on this but it is a scary feeling.  I don’t know what to do.  Any suggestions?

depression,Life isn't worth living after turning 18,"I'm going to turn 18 this month and I feel like life isn't worth living after that. I'm going to become an adult, so I'm looking for a job. It feels very depressing especially with pressure from ""people around me"" constantly telling me to look for one. I need a job so I can buy things and afford college. But, it feels like the reality of adulthood really hits. Even if I get a job I'm just going to be doing the same brain rot activity for the rest of my life, most likely more depressed than ever. They say it gets better but I don't even remember when was the last time I'm genuinely happy. I'm bullied and casted away throughout my school life. I'm a freak, I find it hard to talk to people and people don't want to talk to me. I'm always yelled at, I'm a loser, a freak, a dead body through and though. I wish it was a tradition for people to commit suicide after they reach the age of consent. I wish humanity finally realize that life is sad and we should stop existing altogether. I know there are happy people but even they will feel sad alot the times. The fact that I'm posting this alone makes me a bigger loser. I wish a giant meteor crash my city while I'm asleep. I'm sorry if this post makes anyone more depressed, but I needed to get this off my chest.

At this point my moms abuse has increased. And not just physical emotional and mental. She would insult me and my siblings day and night. Sometimes even for no reason. Whenever she calls me she doesn't call me by my name she calls me by an insult, multiple insults. Last night she pulled my hair just because I said “be quiet it's late don't yell”. Like I'm not disrespecting you I'm just trying to tell you to lower your voice cause people were sleeping. She always does this. I'm currently 13 years old I have been dealing with this shit for tool long. I've tried running away once but I came back because it was winter in Minnesota. I can't call cpd because I have 7 siblings and I don't want us to get separated. And I'm tried of the “just have patience this will end”. I have been waiting for so long. But no one can Dela with shit every single day. And I can't tell a relative cause they're all the same. They all normalize abuse and call it “parenting”. I just wish someone would help. I wish I had a place to stay anywhere. I wish I could runaway. Cause my mother has told me that if I left her house she would consider me dead and not existing. She told me “if you don't like this house than you can leave”. I want to leave but where would I go. I'm depressed and I'm insecure about my body, and my mom has to make it worse by calling me fat and ugly. If anyone can help on anyways please help me. I can't take this shit anymore.

depression,Creating art while depressed,"I’m (32m) have had depression all my life but I wasn’t diagnosed and medicated until 2019. My baseline of my symptoms are very moderate and manageable, so that’s why I never sought help until my late 20’s. During this period, my health rapidly declined because my life situation was very bad and hostile.

I’ve also been an artist all my life. My depression didn’t really affect my passion for drawing, and was even a fuel for inspiration. Art was both my passion hobby and my outlet. However, when my depression got bad during this period, I completely stopped drawing. I know this is normal both from a healthy, artistic perspective because art blocks happens to everyone, but also from a depressed perspective where you lose your passion. I haven’t forced myself to do art, I knew it was a period like that and with enough recovery I’d find my way back to it. I was in no rush.

The thing is, my life is pretty good, stable and comfortable and has been for 3 years. I’m still medicated. But I still struggle to find my passion in drawing. Sometimes I force myself because I’m tired of passively waiting. I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not that I lack passion in drawing, but I’m not passionate about things outside of drawing. A common rule in the art community is “Draw what you’re passionate about”, but whenever I feel ready to draw, my head is blank. It doesn’t matter what subject I try to land on; original characters, fan art, abstract, creature designs, nature, new mediums, gift art, doodle… I feel no pull towards any of it. I sit in malls, in cafe’s, outdoors, in my apartment… being out for the sole purpose TO draw feels so pointless when all I end up doing is staring at my blank canvas, ready to draw, but not feeling like doing any subjects that pops in my head.

I don’t really know how to recover my passion for creativity. I’m trying music, listening to fictional podcasts, watching some series or movie, playing games, but none of that ignite a spark.

I’ve tried to be off my medications to see if it maybe made a difference, but it hasn’t. And ironically, it kinda makes me more depressed to not draw. It feels like I’m mourning something that stopped being a part of me.

asking for help is hard, i know. i didnt know how till recently. im high functional depression so i carry a lot alone. the effects of family violence. gaslighting. emotional and mental abuse.

context: was gonna drop out and move with my aunt. she lives in a different state. im broke, cant find a job, in college, have a record, no contact with my parents, credit card debt that keeps piling up cuz i cant afford the monthly payment since i have to put all the money to a car payment, no insurance, no one to help me pack my things, and someone i care a lot about is moving away. i checked their social media one last time and saw what i needed to see. blocked them ofc, im never gonna lurk again in someones information. seeing his social media one last time is all i needed. he doesnt know how good we are, wish him the best truly. plus i got tired of being treated like i reminded him of an ex. or of other women. he never spent enough time asking me about me. makes sense tho. and its fine. character development 101

 i signed up for a 300 lvl creative writing: poetry course. Not an english major or have the requirements. I've spoken to the teacher before. They email me, that i am in. Another teacher who i asked why did they kept turning down my final?  answered my ideas were not D or C level (i never provide sources or really get into things...i just do the bare minimum) 

i decide to give college one last time, ask for help. advocating is hard lol. college has been hard. BUT i went to a residential hall director, then the dean of student affairs, then the office of victim advocacy, then to a new advisor, then today to the dean, then victim advocacy... and career development. 

Dean helped with figuring my major. in short im gonna do general studies to leave asap and get into a graduate program. Got summer housing approved (out of pocket overdraft yay) but got financial aid for summer classes. its the same hall that i chose for next semester. 21+ 

Advocacy advisor is gonna help with court, i wont go alone June 14! And I can apply for domestic violence housing after that. (the power of volunteering and being honest) 

the new advisor is a woman and she is autistic. So im in great hands. and done with school so i changed to a general studies major to gtfo asap with a piece of paper.

career development helped me fix my resume and start a new job search based on things that i like. opened a whole new world.

if it wasnt for the kind words of a teacher when i needed them, i wouldnt have tried. i was empty. my friend came to my dorm unannounced and kept me company when i needed it the most. she's pretty great, a true empath and intelligent af yet neurodivergent. the hall director is latina, and we spoke for real.  it felt great, to hear this is your education and you deserve to be here felt good.

to hear that im basically writing a master thesis and given a week to do so. If i finish it with sources and throrough i get an A! and by next fall if i submit it for an english conference im all set for scholarships. yet i have to keep getting it reviewed. the thesis is great, and true. yet have to make it PERFECT! i am not an english major but when it comes to literary analysis i am toe to toe with graduate students.

hope this helped someone, seek help and use the resources available. yet call abuse for what it is. and speak all your truth

depression,My social skills deteriorated after a year of workplace bullying,"Hi there! I'm fairly new here but I figured I need to share and possibly find some support...

I've had a toxic teammate at work for over a year, I don't know what happened we just triggered each other all the time and overtime I became very insecure and withdrew from communication because I wanted to avoid conflict. It affected my communication at work and outside of work, where I started to avoid people because simply being around people made me feel overwhelmed.

Before that, I was cheerful and mostly optimistic person, I loved being around people and forging new connections and some people called me a social butterfly (which offended me slightly because I prioritize meaningful connections, at least this is what I want to believe).

Fast forward, I feel overwhelmed, I feel a lot of pressure, fear and insecurity. I see a negative side to everything, as opposed to the happy and positive person as I remember myself. I don't have energy to be around people, I don't have energy to text and respond to text, even to my parents and siblings, which they may find disrespectful but they care for me nonetheless. The colleague changed teams so we don't intersect at work but the job itself makes me feel like I'm stuck in the groundhog day. I can't quit because I don't have savings. And I don't get the benefits unless they fire me. I oscilate between feeling like I have to fight for my life and being completely indifferent to everything. I suffer from headaches.

What is worse, for my anxiety obviously, is that some months ago a drunk colleague walked into my bedroom during a business trip and scared the shit out of me. I had to kick him out, and nothing else happened, but I've been feeling anxious and unsafe ever since. I tried casual dating but every date I had, I was just running different scenarios of being raped and it didn't do me any good. I have trust issues with the world and I don't feel safe.

I have two therapy sessions per week, I meditate, I do a shit ton of sports, I do gardening, I play with my cat and do many other things from self-help threads. I desperately want to get out of this state but I don't know how else I can help myself.

I would like to get some reassurance that recovering my old self is possible, from someone who's experienced similar situations. Sometimes I just feel this is my life  among ghosts because people won't welcome me as one of their own anymore. And I feel sad.

depression,Parent Restricting Medication,"I have been suffering from depression for the past 3+ years, however I only recently got properly diagnosed just 5 months ago. Despite how severe it has been, my mom is still old-fashioned in her thought process. My general physician & therapist know how I have been. A lot of my depression and anxiety is caused by my abusive parent, but things have been better recently when I have been taking 100mg. I am able to tolerate my parent's abuse and not breakdown crying on a near daily basis, allowing me to actually study and accomplish my goals. 

  
Despite this, my parent just restricted my access to my medication. When I was trying to OD on my medication 2 months ago, they sensibly restricted it. Though since then, they started giving me half the dosage and has refilled my medication at only 50mg. I am 18, but I did sign allowing them to pickup prescriptions and such. Since switching me back to 50mg, I started having many depressive episodes of hour-long crying an tiredness. I started taking 100mg again behind their back for the past week and has been going really well as I just aced my finals as I could actually focus.

  
Though just today, my parent found out about me taking 100mg and is now taking the medication away and hoping I can become, ""as strong as them"" by ""reading and listening to podcasts.""

5/10/2024 1:25 AM : to Ray in discord dms

Yknow idk if it's just me being weird cause it's late but I might be genuinely suicidal cause it's like, I mean no matter how hard someone tries, theres really no point. Most won't even try to change no matter how hard you try, people are just gonna not care. It's like, nobody would care if it didn't help them in some way. Kinda like the world would be better off, well dead. Or at the very least more useful. I mean, half the people in my life probably would just feel a little sad. My friends at school would probably just have an assembly and then forget after a week. Honestly there's no good parts about me. I'm an asshole. Honestly I might as well kill my self. It's not even that nobody would care. Thinking that someone would care would be selfish. And then the fact that, if it doesn't work, then the aftermath would suck ass. If you live while trying to kill yourself, then you have to have CPS, therapy, people treat you differently, you stop being yourself and after all that you just wanna, well do it. I mean, after all, why not. Would the world really be that bad, if one kid died? I mean people die every second. Nobody cares about anything I do. Nobody would care if I killed myself. If I jumped off a building hundreds of feet in the air, would things be alright? No more school, most things I play anymore aren't worth it. If I had a choice, I would rather kill my self with people thinking I got shot, then go on with this miserable world. Jesus is this sad. I'm so sad and lonely that I would rather talk to myself than do anything. Oh yeah, I should mention that I'm not gonna send this. Well, I might send this. I don't even know what I'm doing lately. I get through the day, try to relax, and repeat. The only enjoyable parts are when like, idk when you me Zane and Aiden are vc'ing, or playing games, that's really the only good part. Honestly, I don't even know if I'll make it to summer before I kill myself. Well, I'll probably make it to summer, halfway through though, if I disappear for more than a week, I will have killed myself. None of this will be any of the friend groups fault, it's just the days are so meaningless. No happiness, no sadness, nothing. Just a empty. Fucking. Void. Of nothing. I wonder what's wrong with me. Did I do something wrong? Maybe. I can't do much else but add to this as I go on I guess. I'm gonna label these suicide notes as like the date so when I'm dead, at least you guys will know why. Alr, I'm gonna stop writing for now. It's been a while. Also, if you want any movie recommendations, watch a silent voice. Such a good movie (: anyways, cya later.

The way I'm probably gonna do it, would be getting all of my adhd meds, as they arnt hard to swallow at all, and they are like 40 mg, and i would easily be able to swallow like 30, as thats all they give in one bottle, at least for now i think. im probaly gonna make it to summer before i kill myself, but im not too sure. im just gonna write some ideas out, well not really ideas, but just in general my thoughts.  i would like to say, that the years of fun that the friend group has given me, has been amazing. i really don’t deserve it either. i’ve already tried once to kill myself, and obviosly it didn’t work, but the bad part about it, is that after it happened, you have to do therapy, CPS, and people treat you like a stranger. not to mention, that i got one day off, and then violently sick, after trying to klil myself. like, in my opinion, you should get like a week. in this world, people really don’t care about you though. people will always try to atake advantage of you, and if you trust them, then that sucks alot. i feel like people will never truely change. like, hear me out. if someone gets one rough idea about you, then thats all they know you for, and any other thoughts about you just dont really matter. i gotta say, the world really wouldnt care if i was dead. i mean, im sure itech would have like a assembly about it for like a week, and then they wouldn’t care anymore. no one fucking cares. the world is very cruel. if i were to kill myself right now, well it would be hard because i dont have the adhd meds on me right now, but if i did, i feel like i would be at peace. kinda like, while i would be missed a little, everything would be alright. i feel like i would be better off dead. im not contributing to anything in the entire world.  i have no idea why, but the idea of suicide to me, really isn’t that bad. i mean, its really easy too. like, just take 50 pills, and you die. when i die, i would like to have my pc given to ray, as i said i would give it to him for christmas 2024, after i get a new one, but i don’t want to leave him without a good one. yknow idk if rays told you this, but his sister tried to kill herself because she had alot of mental problems. she tried to OD too. honesetly, like i said earlier, it isn’t hard at all. i don’t know all of the details, but it sounds rough. i gotta say, this whole note is all really written with the message, that i really just want peace. i would go to hell, but to make others happy would be great. thats why im always online with discord, and i try to play games with you guys whenever i can. thats really all my life is about anymore. nothing but trying to make others happy. thats why it makes me very sad, that even when you say its school work, i feel like you really just don’t wanna talk to me. just makes me feel like i did something bad. btw unless you arn’t asleep ( like if it was at 12pm that i sent this message) i probaly have like 10-15 minutes before i do it. i wouldn’t say any of these things to any of you, unless i was about to do it. damn, i was just thinking about how, even if i did something i was really proud of, no one would give a god damn shit. if i became a bridge celestial, or something else im proud of, most would just say something like, “oh cool” or “nice” or, “ok” before switching the subject. if i got all A’s in my classes, people would just think, “oh you haven’t been getting strait A’s all year? wow your fucking retarded”. no matter what i do, nobody cares. why even bother anymore. theres no fucking point to this. i cant do this. i hop you guys have a good time.  the friend group and my family, are really the only people who i hope have a good time. don’t blame you, or anyone else for this either. this was my own fault. i deserve to die. alone. in the bathroom. at like 3:43 AM on a tuesday. alright, i think its time to end this all, and to end everything else. have a good one. remember me as that one guy, who tried to make you guys laugh, tried to make you guys happy, and tried my fucking hardest to make your life better, because mine is a waste at this point.

depression,Feeling really sad tonight and thinking about stupid memories,"Family vacation to medieval times restaurant performance thing as a child. One of the actors threw me a rose. In that moment, I felt seen. In the entire crowd of people, I was seen. He threw it towards me. I needed to forever cherish that moment by saving the white rose. Immediately after my little sister wanted to hold it but I refused. After some going back and forth, the rose snapped off the stem. My mom said we could press it into a book so it would be alright but it began wilting before we ever could. We threw it away. The evidence of me existing was trashed. 

There’s this saying in my family that there’s a middle child curse where the middle child ultimately cuts off their family or isn’t really present. My uncle on my dad’s side and my mom. Every family reunion we attended while I was growing up, they’d say I’ll probably fall into that curse and it really hurt but if I ever said anything, it would be a joke. 

One time my family invited my first and current boyfriend to go out for dinner with my sisters and their boyfriends. They forgot about us. They made the plans but never told us when or where. When my sister came home, I asked about it and she said she had just came back from it. I was so embarrassed. My boyfriend saw just how forgettable I was to them.

I’m a trans non-binary guy, which has just become so difficult in dealing with lately. 

But as of very recent, I’ve become so aware of things like my body image even more than before, including worrying about calories often. My mood tends to be ranging a lot towards agitation and sometimes not being in the mood to talk to or listen to anyone. Sometimes causing me to lash out.

depression,It has become increasingly difficult to remain somewhat functional. I'm afraid of driving into a wall,"I'm currently studying, so there's lots of tedious assignments and shit like that. Since I have no motivation or joy in my life I procrastinate it as long as possible and then do it in a short time span. The whole process is pretty much agony and I hate myself for being lazy. But I don't know how long I can keep that up, I made it through the first semester but it feels like every of these ""work cycles"" drains more energy away. Right now I don't know if I can get myself to do the next round. A stringent routine keeps me functioning on an everyday level but everything beyond that is just incredibly difficult. It feels like my higher thinking capacities are fried and clouded, my mind cycles around fleeing from responsibility and suicidal ideation. If I do assignments it's rushed and connected to frustration and anger. I go outside, I visit new places, I come back and feel exactly as shitty as before. I try to socialise, realise that I'm unable to really connect to anyone, and get back to loneliness.

depression,How to support my girlfriend,"Hey everyone

I’ve with my girlfriend for 7 months now (both 19 y/o) and a couple months ago I kinda figured out she has depression and has had it for years. She was suicidal a bit before we got together but insists she isn’t right now and has pinky promised to tell me if she feels it again. 

I really don’t know what to do. I comfort her and hold her whilst she’s crying but I’ve never experienced anything like this so it’s hard to know what to say. She doesn’t know why she’s so sad all the time either. She’s got an appointment with our university well being team on Tuesday, it’s a 1-1 thing so I hope it’ll go somewhat well. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to navigate this. I really do love her and I want her to feel even a tiny bit better.

depression,So many changes and challenges lately. ,"I (25m) worked at my favorite bar for a year, and one of my good friends (38m) ended up becoming my boss. After that first year, the graveyard bar shift was really wearing on my mental health and my boss noticed this. Throughout that year, a few other bar employees and I were helping our boss fix up & repaint an old office space in the building, it slowly but surely became the Smoke shop it is now. My boss, being of a rare few *caring* managers, offered me a day job in the shop, to potentially help my mental state. I was becoming over-stimulated and never saw sunlight, my depression brought me to an attempt on my life, after which my closest friend kept me at her house for a week & made sure I was safe,  my boss was privy to the entire situation and gave me asmuch time as I needed, with the guarantee my job wasn't going anywhere. I started a day shift (9am-5pm) at the smoke shop about 2 months ago, I make about $3 less per hour, and lost my bar tips ($2-300 per week). I made the switch to hopefully remedy my depression and get on a healthier sleep schedule. I put in my two weeks today, and I plan to go back to hotel work, as I did plenty of in my late teens/early twenties. I can't stand customer service, I will *never* be passionate about selling vapes and bongs, dealing with extremely rude or sketchy customers, and the constant fear/anxiety of potentially getting robbed. Not to mention I'm barely scraping by financially at this job. I haven't secured a new job yet, but I have a list of places to apply to. I guess the whole point of this is to express how terrified I am to make such a change in my life again, I'm so scared I may have made the wrong decision. I'm an expert at catastrophizing almost everything in my life, and I still can't tell when it's justified or outlandish. I don't have a ""dream career"" or anything I'd love to do (other that writing/directing, which is not an easy goal to achieve these days), I JUST want to make enough money to live, at a job I don't *hate*. That's it, but it seems like an impossible achievement anymore. I'm so fucking tired of trying to stay alive, and in doing so, draining myself of any miniscule will to live.

I was just prescribed Lexapro 10mg. After a devastating loss, I’ve been lying in my bed for 2 months. Apparently, I’ve been depressed for many years but just forced myself to live with it until this event happened to me and opened up my eyes. 

Long story short, I have a history of mental illness (as does my family)…but apparently I’m pretty good at masking symptoms. I’ve also had 2 concussions so living comfortably with this mind has been a bit challenging. 

I’m itching to increase my dose to 20mg. However, I’m obviously no doctor but I’ve read that 20mg showed no more benefit than 10mg….soooo. I took Paxil in high school but I felt no difference. Seems like every drug I take, I don’t “feel a difference”.

depression,The idea of death feels peaceful ,"I’ve been depressed and have struggled with mental illnesses and heartbreak for about 4 years. Only since last year did I start thinking about the idea of death being a kind fate compared to living in this world.

ever since I got heartbroken at the lowest point of my mental health it’s been a downward spiral and I often almost everyday would shut myself in my room and thought that dying to an illness or dying alone is the only thing that accurately represents the way I feel and what life feels like. 

I don’t wanna say “death” per se. Because it’s more like I’m seeking rest or definitive peace. “Death” sounds like something that’s attacking you or hurting you. But I mean the idea of sleeping and having peace. Finally not having to put up with mental illness, trauma, further disappointment, impotence, feeling like a robot and so on. Like wanting to doze off into a dream and be healed there, somewhere that feels far away from here.

Sometimes I have thought about the kind of tragic endings you see on media where the main character dies bleeding out to wounds and dies alone in a forest or in a secluded area. I have thought that that’s what reality seems to want for me. It’s just been tragedy after tragedy like I’m just some puppet taking the hits like an empty vessel and losing its humanity. Like the world is just meant to make you suffer as much as possible and take everything away from you until you forget you’re a human being. 

I guess part of the problem and of my melancholy is being numbed out from my body and perceiving coldness and indifference from everything. I mean what bigger proof than that is there than being heartbroken and cut off by the person you loved the most like you were nothing? 

It’s not like wanting to actively die, but the imagery I have often thought about is like wanting some escape and rest from that turmoil and from reality. Wanting solace and to heal. I guess not living feels like a nicer ending than having to wake up everyday with traumatic painful thoughts that never end and yet feeling them distant. Like living an inescapable curse.

It’s just so hard to escape this mentally because everything and everyone around you just confirms that this is true. That your hopes don’t come true. That magic doesn’t exist. That life for most of us is just a game of slowly seeing how all of your beliefs, desires and sense of sanity crumble down. Because reality can exist without any of these, and therefore, it eventually will. It’s only a matter of time before you see it for yourself. No matter how many years or how much you think things are a given. Even the most basic sense of sanity.

I’m too tired to try again and I’d like to be healed. Because I’ve tried challenging negative beliefs, getting over my trauma and heartbreaks, over resentment and everything, to be optimistic, to look at the bright side for years, and somehow managing it all these times, but then something happening making me sink even lower and face even bigger problems. There’s just a point when you are exhausted to the core of not anything making a difference. It has felt as if no matter how much I tried to be optimistic, reality would only show me worse and worse things to the point I was surprised of how bad they were. 

I’ve tried looking for an escape in spirituality. In God. But it’s as if he doesn’t exist or care about me in particular. Just this afternoon I was thinking how disappointing reality turned out to be and that I have to accept that God doesn’t exist or at least doesn’t exist for me. That that is the kind of cursed world I live in.  Some genuine shock at the fact that that is indeed the truth of the reality I am in. For years, it felt like maybe the mental solution is to simply take the stance of your experiences having value simply because you’re alive and you will fight for that concept of individuality. And the reason I keep going and try to fight is because of precisely that. But that seems such a sad and lonely existence. One where God doesn’t exist and you know none of your actions have meaning.

depression,I can't feel certain emotions anymore. ,"So I'm 26 (soon to be 27 as of next week) I've been suffering from both anxiety and depression for a very long time, for years in factblike my whole life almost, still no idea what caused it either like it could of been my terrible time at school growing up or something else idk. 

Anyways like I said I'm in my mid to late 20's now and I've got no job due to terrible mental health, no friends, no social life, nothing. All I have is my games because yes I am a gamer and anime fan, I know right a big nerd. 

I've been in several relationships in my life, at least 8 or 9 if I remember correctly and have even slept with at least 6 or 7 of them. However they all treated me poorly and did terrible things to me which yes did effect me a lot over the years and in a way still kinda does.

However it's been 4 to 5 years since my last relationship and sexual interaction and lately I've felt my mental state has dropped even more because not only do I have zero friends (I've always been an outcast and kind of a loner unfortunately) but also no relationships either and I'm feeling lost and kinda lonely now. 

You'd think I'd be used to being on my own all of the time and tbh I kinda am, heck I was even able to focus on myself a bit and not be bothered if I was single or not. 

However.....that's kind of changed. I've now found myself wanting and craving that love and affection, both the physical and the emotional but there's a problem. Well more like multiple problems.

Problem one is the fact I can't seem to attract anyone at all, now idk if this is because I'm ugly, don't have a well paying job or because I'm not the most absolutely shredded and athletic guy around with huge pecks or whatever or if this is due to having zero social life for years. Though despite this I have tried to push forward and make an effort however this brings me to the other problem.

I for some reason can no longer feel attraction towards anyone, be it sexual attraction or otherwise. I can't get aroused, can barely maintain an erection let alone get one anymore, I just feel nothing despite the fact I really want to. 

Like idk what's going on, I used to be able to do all of these things perfectly fine but now I just can't seem to at all and I'm not sure how to fix it. It's like I've completely lost my ability to get horny, feel sexual attraction or even feel any sort of love, affection or emotional attraction and connection at all. 

I need help or advice because idk what's going on like am I turning Asexual? Or is it something else like I've lost my drive that I used to have long ago and I miss it. I just wish I could go back to the way I was before. I don't want to be asexual, I want to be able to feel things like I used to.

And there's no getting out of it: make tons of money and people will pretend to like you for your money but still secretly hate you like the old moneybag fart that you are.

Yet worse of course if you don't have money, then you're just flat out superfluous and no one wants anything to do with you, no place for you in the world. 

Oh and everyone will blame it on you, because again no compassion for the ugly.

I think about seeing a prostitute from time to time. The power dynamic will just ruin my self esteem for good: I'm like a bug compared to the most average looking or even below average woman.

I am a 32 years old guy I am a civil engineer (which is a major I don’t like and was kinda forced by my family)however I never got lucky finding a job in my major graduated 2017 snd till now cant find a job and now I am working as a customer care agent in a very bad company with a very trash working conditions thought about changing my career to UX/UI but I lose interest in anything very easily, I just lost interest in everything that used to bring me joy, right now I just live for the next day to come and that’s it.

For the past 32 years of my life I never had a girlfriend nor a relationship with anyone ( still a virgin ) I am scared of talking to girls and scared of the thoughts of marriage and of commitment and even scared of sex and being intimate with someone.

For most of my life I was overweight and every time I ho on a diet I lose some weight and then lose interest and gain weight again about 5 months ago I started a diet again lost around 20 kilograms of fat ( around 44 pounds) and started going to the gym but again lost interest in it and now gained weight again.

I don’t know what am I supposed to do I want to change my life but I am always get the feeling that it’s not worth it, it will not matter, I will fail no matter how hard I try then I lose interest again.

depression,Just dread,"I’m 22, and it’s hard to get words out to describe my feelings right now but I also feel like I need to get it out. I feel dread. Point blank dread. I feel like something is slowly crushing me from the inside… well no, that’s not right. It’s something more uhh, abstract, around the corner. It’s going to slowly poison me until there’s nothing left. Maybe I need to talk to someone about it but I don’t know who to ask. So I’m here. It literally sounds insane but I’m trying my utmost hardest to convey this sense of anxiety in a way that makes sense. I have a hard time trying to be real and authentic. I don’t know, I think Im trying to get myself out of a thinking loop by writing it down and having someone try to talk to me. It’s like a feedback loop, propelling itself like a damn perpetual motion machine. Maybe it’s like being stuck inside a box, or rather a circular maze with no exits, because at least in a box I wouldn’t be confused about my condition. Maybe… maybe I need something, but I don’t know what. Honestly I’m just writing words down to keep myself grounded. I don’t even know why I’m posting it on Reddit, probably for validation or something, not like my thoughts make a whole lot of sense as they are anyways. Breathing, moving fingers, breathing again…

 if you want a point to this jumbled mess it’s that I’m feeling anxious from the medication increase, something about how too much serotonin can cause increased anxiety. It makes me think about my whole life too much, paralyzes me so that I’m unable to take action or feel relaxed and I end up incapable of performing tasks. Don’t get me wrong I should be productive too just like anybody else, cause if everyone was feeling good all the time then nothing would get done, but that’s precisely what gets me. Like I’m caught in a feedback loop again of… if you can’t perform tasks to get happy, why do them at all?

I end up sleeping in my room all day to avoid the hellish emotions in my brain or I do what I’m doing now. I went on a run today to try to expel the anxiety but that only helped for a while. I wonder if the reason I can’t make friends is for this negative attitude. I can’t make excuses for myself but I end up doing so anyway. I become afraid of change, of progress, of change… creeping fingers that work their way up my neck as lemon juice floods my brain and I can’t understand my own thoughts. 

I don’t look for pity I really don’t, and I’m really not having a mental break like this post is making it seem. I think I’m a perfectly rational person with rational ways of viewing things… it’s just that my emotions have an unfortunate quality to them. It’s like I want a new perspective to tell me I don’t have to try so hard… but if they do will I stop trying? If I get called out for sounding insane I could just delete the post so it’s not like I have to feel dread too much in that respect. Back to the main point…

I am on ssi and ssd getting 158 on the first and 805 on the 3rd. the ssd is after both my parents passed they put me on my dads disability drawing off what he earned working but I was originally on ssi to begin with.

I get about 963 a month total to live on. Right now I am in major debt with credit cards since covid broke out. I had to use them to live on. 

I moved in with my aunt who is living in apartments based on income but they are not section 8 but they accept section 8. When i moved in, i was told by the manager i didn't need to put my income since i was a cotenant. that was 10 yrs ago. come to find out. i had to put my income now i am being sued by the housing authority for 10k, i owe two more years. my aunt and i pay 220 a month to them. they don't care what happened they just want their money. 

i owe one credit card company 4.5k, another 1.8k another 600 and another 700. when i applied for them, it was 3 plus years ago. i put that i made around 700k a year when i applied to them but i was on ssdi at the time making around 11k a year. i went on the websites 3 months ago fixed the right info.

I live in a small town where nothing is available for the next 20 plus miles and have no transport. my aunt won't take me anywhere. her son who si in his late 30's lives with us and works. my aunt is on disability. I get food stamps right now worth a 130 a month which goes to my aunt even though its for me. i pay her 450 a month rent incl internet lights and 130 in food. if i don't give her the food stamps then i have to pay her another 130 a month i can't afford since all my stuff is going to her and credit cards. i legit have nothing left each month right now with having to buy myself instant mashed potatoes, oatmeal top ramen soup, noodles and spaghetti sauce. i live on that through the month. 

when she buys food with the food stamps it feeds her son, me and her. but it is only enough to last a week, then for the next 3 weeks i am starving barely eating because i can't afford much when i do buy stuff that i can put in my bedroom to eat on.

past week now, there has been no food, her son has been taking his mom and him out to eat all week not bringing anything home for me. im so hungry. the nearest food bank is 4 miles away one way, but i have no way to get there my aunt won't take me they don't deliver and when i tried getting medicaid transport to take me they said they don't schedule rides except to and from the dr's.  

I have no other family, I have no friends. I have no vehicle. been trying to get a minivan so I could live in it. I am sometimes bed ridden due to my bad joints/back/knees/feet/right leg nerve damage. I also struggle from morbid obesity I am around 500 lbs and funny thing is, with how little i eat. i should be losing weight but its the complete opposite. 

I will be 47 yrs old when I am out of debt with the credit card companies, I tried filing bankruptcy no one will touch me being under 10k in debt with the credit card companies. i contacted legal aid, the attorney who called me back said he can't help me because its under 10k. but told me how to file but chances of me filing and getting it are slim to none esp without legal help he said.

im thinking of ending my life next month when my aunt and her son leave for a week. I just can't keep living like this. if i had a minivan I could stay in it, do door dash for extra money, I could get around trying to find an aparment based on income. I bene accepted a few times to low income places but had no way to get there and now with all the debt I wouldn't be able to afford having my own place with the credit card debt.

if i stop paying the cards, and the debt collectors come after me,  they could take me to court and if they do, they could show the judge i said i made 700k a year and i didn't make that much and was on disability at the time and making only 11k a year. i found out while looking into bankruptcy that it is fraud and i could face prison time.

i just don't know what to do anymore. i really don't know what to do anymore other than ending things next month to get out of this situation i put myself in with my aunt, debt, etc. I just can't do it anymore esp without a vehicle. esp since I am bed ridden half of the day here and there due to my bad joints and weight that i have carried around for 30 yrs destroying my joints and causing nerve damage to my right leg. I can't just get up and go on the streets and live on the streets not with how badly im in pain every day esp just walking to the corner store. just a simple walk to the corner store and back and i am bed rested for an entire day barely able to move.

depression,I feel like I’m doomed no matter what,"Even though nothing extremely bad has happened to me for a while, I feel like I’m doomed no matter what I decide to do in life. I keep thinking about how either friends or people I know around my age have already accomplished so much like having an amazing career or being really talented at something, while I’m just plain old me.

There’s something that I have to prepare for, but I haven’t done much preparing yet because I keep losing motivation to do it. I’ve already gone through something like this before and things didn’t go well for me the first time and I experienced a lot of burnout and extreme depression.  

I’ve also been feeling a lot of anhedonia lately and things that are supposed to make me happy don’t have the same effect anymore. I think it might be because even though I’ve achieved something that I’ve wanted for a long time (finding actual friends), it took a really really long time, whereas other people that I know have had friends since childhood. I know I shouldn’t compare myself, and that I should be more grateful because so many people don’t even have a single friend, but I think I’m feeling this way because the way I found these friends was completely based on luck. And for most of my life, I’ve had the worst luck ever. So now I feel a sort of emptiness knowing how even if I try my best to achieve something, it could lead to nothing or will only happen decades in the future, and who knows if I’m even alive by then.

I don’t know what to do next. I feel like no matter what I do to change things, something bad is going to happen to stop me. I feel like my goals or what used to be my goals suddenly feel like they’re impossible to achieve.",0.228,0.086,0.685

i hurt my back and wasn’t able to sit for for extended periods of time (have a herniated disc). i still took her out becuase she’s on her period and needs comfort around this time. she will call me about 5x a day to complain about it for a week every month. 

she asked me to set the time on her rolex that i bought her while we were in the car. i was driving and it was a minute off so she asked me to set it correctly. i told her it’s close engouh and she wears it 8 hours and 10 days off 90 percent of the time because she doesn’t know how to do it and she went off on me. she told me she needs it set correctly and to do it immediately.

i was still driving and just couldn’t deal with it. this is a monthly occurrence with similar outbursts. i do admit i am a bit cold during these moments but i feel so broken that it’s hard not to. i’m literally barely able to move and still make an effort to take her shopping and to dinner and just being treated like a dog sets me off which then sets her off i think

It's all I do, I drink to forget everything. I always cry for my son, his father says I won't get him back, I was doing so good in the beginning until we had fallen back into that toxic cycle we had before. I left the day he screamed at me, something told me he was going to hit me again. I left everything, my sons stuff I bought him, my clothes, everything. It hurts, I left his pictures there.

Yesterday was the final straw, he always reminds me of how bad of a mother I am. I didn't even get the chance to be a mother, yet he reminds me that I am. I feel like I'm a bad mother, I put that asshole before my own child. I feel guilty everyday, I'm crying as I type this. He calls me ugly, he uses everything against me.

I just don't know where to start in my writing. So much has been going on in my life recently and I just haven't been handling it well at all- I've tried but I keep getting a sinking feeling in my stomach with each thought.




I have been dealing with lonliness for all of my adult life. I just turned 26 not too long ago and every time I look in the mirror I just think what a pathetic person I am to not have had a relationship yet at this point in my life. I see so many people in relationships around me and I get so sad when I see them; I'm happy that they're happy together but I always reflect that onto myself and how I don't have that. As pathetic as this sounds, I can't even watch movies or TV shows that have intimate relationships in them because I'll get too sad.




My whole life, I've been made out to believe that I'm always the problem. When I was a kid, none of my neighborhood friends invited me to play baseball in their yard, I would always have to go over there myself and ask if I could play because they didn't think I was athletic or liked sports. I was always the last on the wall in elementary school recess when it came to picking teams: nobody wanted me. I loved playing sports and I loved video games as a kid, but my friends always saw me as the kid who wants to stay inside gaming all day long instead of playing with them.




I still feel this carries with me today. Nobody wants me, even after repeatedly putting myself out there. My own siblings don't want me. I have a brother and a sister (both younger; my sister is two years younger and my brother is a bit younger than her) who barely interact with me, but they are always laughing and memeing and hanging out with each other without me. Just tonight, my sister asked my brother if he wanted to go fishing but they didn't even bother to ask me. My interactions with my siblings seem to be limited to one sentence a day and it makes me want to cry because I love them so much but I don't see any of that love returned to me.




Another thing that has been getting me very upset is how one of, well, I thought she was my friend, has been treating me on social media, specifically on snapchat she would reply to my stories with real snarky and mean comments if I seemed to be enjoying myself. We used to work together just about a year ago and we had a great working relationship which ended up turning to a friendship. Ever since I left my job, she has been treating me so poorly, once again, making me feel like I did something to her. We have really drifted apart now that I left my job but I always made sure to ask how she's been doing from time to time- I get very generic, uninterested answers and she never ONCE asked how I've been doing. What am I doing wrong to deserve this?




I have nobody.

I've long since resolved old struggles with self-harm, and am in no danger of hurting myself.

  
I've been lonely for a long time. There have been points in my life where I've had close friends I can confide in, and I've even been in relationships with several people who genuinely cared for me, at least one of whom was in love with me. When I get lonely I remind myself that many lonely people don't have memories of times like these, and that I'm lucky to have had those experiences at all, even if they're over now. Lately that hasn't been enough though. I wish that somebody knew me.  


My last relationship ended badly 6 years ago. My ex-partner got all of our mutual friends in the breakup. I was left with a group of a few married older male friends who see me as a seat-filler. When they plan a game night but don't have enough people, they invite me to fill in because they know that I don't have a social life and won't say no. They don't think of me as a real person and I can't talk to them about anything real.  


My father is dying. In March I went to see him and after we'd said hello, before we'd even sat down, he asked me ""so how's your social life?"" He knows what kind of life I've ended up with and I think he wants to feel better about it before he dies. I told him about a board game night I'd been to not long before, hoping that he'd believe everything was fine. I don't want him to worry about me when he's the one dying.  


My doctor gave me some antidepressants after I told him about how I've been feeling lately during a physical last week. I've been taking them as directed for one week now, but nothing's changed yet unless you count the crying. On Wednesday, for the first time in my adult life, I cried. I was sitting in my car in a grocery store parking lot waiting for it to be time to go to work, and I was thinking about how things are going, and I had the feeling of just so badly wanting to speak with someone who cared about me even a little bit and a wave of tears just came pouring out of me and then stopped just as suddenly. It happened again this evening, and once more while I was writing this. I mist up at the end of movies sometimes, but the last time I cried was the fifth grade.  


I don't see any way to adjust this. I've been depressed before, so I know that one of things it does to me is make me think there's no way to make it stop. But when I try to figure out what change I can make to avoid living the rest of my life with this feeling of appalling bleakness, I can't come up with anything. I need friends, but I don't know how to make them. And my mood is too dismal to give it a real attempt. And my appearance is such that other people's first impressions of me are not great.  


Does anyone have advice for coping with loneliness?",0.067,0.129,0.804
depression,i can’t stop eating,"i started a diet and working out because of this girl, and she was my best friend. i did a lot of things w her and i honestly was really happy, but the things she did used to cause me a lot of stress because im used to being in my own bubble a lot. 

i lost weight pretty rapidly and i really felt my life picking up again, my grades were good and i felt like getting out of my bed with having a ton of motivation. and before this i had a lot of depressive episodes from loneliness and anxiety due to hormones, because i lost weight and took medication it regulated normally. this is when i started feeling happy and actually being productive, i just felt like i needed her to be okay.

but then i started having stress again because i skipped on meds and there was a lot of drama in school. this started a ton of shit between us, i had a lot of anxiety and we started arguing pretty frequently because she started weed (we are minors). and then we just stopped being friends.

the worst part of us stopping our friendship is because i think i crave her attention. she liked me, and honestly i don’t think i like her even now but what i did like is how she really treated me like the only person in the world that she cared about. 

we hung out a lot and i adopted some of her habits regarding appetite and food. we would share meals, count calories together and walk frequently. honestly, she was the main reason as to how and why i lost weight. 

but now that we aren’t friends anymore i literally don’t feel like leaving my bed. i have no motivation, im getting like no sleep, my grades are okay at best. i barely talk to my friend group outside of school, and even in school i have to force myself to be normal which is another layer of stress. and to top it all off, i keep on binging and stress eating. it’s so bad and i cannot stop myself from eating. it gives me a momentary sense of relief and although the flavor of any food is so bland now i still can’t stop eating. i can’t talk about this to anyone because the only one who would understand about this is that girl, my parents just keep on commenting on my appetite and they are saying im going to get fat again and im going to be ugly. im so fucking tired of everything, i just want to lay in my bed and eat",0.204,0.151,0.646
depression,Can’t Commit Suicide ,"I was forced to be a sexual item for the men that belong to my mom’s family from the moment I was born to 15 years old. My mom and brother knew about it and did nothing. My mom’s other family members knew about it and did nothing. 

Why didn’t I do anything? All of these men were older and bigger than me. I had no idea the trauma happened until I realized it at 12 years old. I was confused because these people were supposed to love me and protect me. My mom begged me not to tell anyone, not a single person, of what was happening to me. 

I have severe diagnosed anxiety and major depression. I’m fighting suicidal and homicidal thoughts every day. 

Here’s the thing: I can’t commit suicide. This has nothing to do with my will. It’s because my dad committed suicide and I can’t put my mom and brother through that pain again. I’ve worked past the hatred and resentment I felt for the two of them after long talks during the years that went by after I was 22 years old. 

The trauma still affects me. So I’m living a terrible life, just to be alive for them. I have to be alive for the two people that ruined my childhood. I have to be alive so my friends aren’t sad I’m gone. 

Why do I have to suffer so that others don’t have to suffer? 

Don’t tell me things will get better because they won’t and I won’t explain why. Don’t tell me to go to therapy because I can’t afford it and I truly don’t have the time. Don’t tell me to change my mindset. 

I’m going to keep living a life I don’t want to live, for the sake of others. I’m here to vent, please no advice or criticism ",0.093,0.204,0.703
depression,Failed Most of My Classes This Semester; Feeling Worthless,"I'm an 18F college student who just finished her second semester. I basically lost my job and failed the majority of my classes this semester, and withdrew from one. I feel worthless. Last semester I ended with a 3.94 GPA, and my English teacher recommended me to be an English tutor personally. I've struggled with depression all of my life but it never has affected me so badly before. So I failed the English class so I won't be a tutor, I failed math and nutrition (I got C in each but I needed an 80 or above since I'm a nursing major) and I don't know if I'm going to pass microbio. I feel the worst about English because my teacher had so much faith in me and I ruined my opportunity. 

I told my mom but haven't told my dad and he keeps saying how proud of me he is and I feel like a disappointment. I failed because I stopped showing up to class and didn't do the work. I could barely get out of bed and I lost one of my friends, who took it to heart that I ignored her for two weeks even though I was really depressed. I don't even know why I'm depressed, as nothing triggered the event like it has in the past. I'm going back to therapy but I don't know what to do. 

Should I ask my English teacher to retake the class? I really need a job on campus. I'm thinking of retaking math at a community college this summer and transferring the credits. I haven't cried in months, I've just felt numb, but I finally cried for the first time this week but I can't stop. I feel a relapse coming into my ED and SH behaviors and I want to stop it before I do something I regret. I'm not suicidal but I just don't know what my purpose is in life anymore and what I'm meant to do. I want to drop out but I know that's not the answer.",0.121,0.185,0.693
depression,Love,I wish I wasn't self aware. To be completely oblivious to all my faults. I'm crazy. I think I fall in love to easily.  Anyway there's this girl. She's absolutely beautiful. Her smile is perfect. One time I was playing fireflies by owl city and during the part where it goes the world turns slowly she started dancing and I couldn't stop staring at her. I know she doesn't feel the same though. I keep trying to tell myself that but I can't get her out of my head. My entire day is based on her. If she even talks to me a little bit my mood automatically goes up. If I don't see her at all then it's like my day didn't mean anything. Anyway to get to the point I guess I just don't know what to do. Before I started having feelings for her I was ok I wasn't good but I was getting through it. Now I'm spiraling. It's getting to a point to where I'm going to break and I don't know what I'm gonna do.,0.136,0.038,0.826
depression,Alright ya'll im signing off.,"No im not ending my life(yet) 

And this is not a rant, (well maybe.)

However i noticed that this sub, or any sub for that matter does nothing for me. I dont want to shame this sub or anything. But what i have noticed that its mainly just kinda like life updates or people who go for advice but hardly get it. Is this really a sub for depression? Or is it just when people are feeling down? Im kinda confused.

However i do understand that alot of people go through things. And i used to check this sub everyday for something. Some motivation, something that will change my worldview and give me the will to live. 

But i often feel worse everytime i check here.
The comparison, its like, ""these people are complaining, yet they got it better than me."" Then what am i? An anomoly, no longer human? Because i stick out even among fellow depressed people. 

And a part of me wants to keep checking here. But i dont think that motivation or anything to change my worldview is coming. Just someone having a midlife crisis or talking about how they feel down because something is not going their way. 

(Again no shade. I promise)

depression,I have so many reasons to be depressed,"Biggest problem for me is loneliness, no friends, never dated. I’ve never had a job and it’s killing me. I’ve tried so hard to get one. I’m terrified I’ll never have a job and live with parents forever or be homeless. But I’m also scared of working. Redditors say they have no life because of work and it killed all their dreams and that terrifies me. I’m not good enough at anything creative to do it as a job which is my dream. I’m very ugly. I have a bunch of mental illnesses. I absolutely hate living with parents, even though I know I’m really lucky. I’ve applied to every job from flipping burgers to cleaning to better jobs like admin. Over 1000 applications, the only job that has ever showed interest in me is teaching because of my English degree. But honestly I don’t want to do it. I hate young kids, and I don’t have the leadership skills to teach high school, I could never be taken seriously as an authority figure, I could never control a class if they misbehaved, they would bully me for being gay, weird and soft. I can’t shout and it’s easy to make fun of anything I say. Worst of all I can’t read students essays because their hand writing is completely unreadable to me, and I’m dyslexic so marking 50+ essays a week is beyond my ability, I wouldn’t be able to get it done. I would love to teach a small group of well behaved students who love English but that’s not realistic and the actual job doesn’t appeal to me at all. I would prefer to work in a cinema or something but they aren’t hiring me. Earning money just feels so imaginary to me, I really can’t see it happening. 

I just want a friend more than anything but people are so superficial. I’ve wondered why people go along with the crowd, obsess over hot people, ghost you, etc because I think people are better than that deep down. But I think they go along with it because they’re bitter about the unfairness of life. Everyone will comment on people’s appearances and shit even if they know it’s wrong, even me, it’s the whole “if you can’t beat them join them” attitude. 

I’m basically just utterly fucked in every way and have no future. The only thing I have is my privileged background and the option to abuse substances. The thought of never having a job makes me suicidal, and the thought of doing an awful job just to come home to a life I hate also makes me suicidal. But the job option doesn’t seem to be on the table for me no matter how hard I try. I’ve been desperate to make my life better for so long and tried so hard it feels like there’s nothing left I can do about it. I can’t even commit suicide because I’m too scared and I still want to be happy too much to give up. I’m just trapped in this empty sad and hopeless life. ",0.147,0.238,0.616

depression,I don’t like myself,"Hello, 
I 29F feel like I have failed at life completely. 
I’ve struggled with depression, ED, anxiety, religious trauma, and ptsd since as early as I can remember. I always told myself that I was going to finish college and be successful, but none of that happened. I accept that the choices I made in life are what got me here, but I’m just so scared I will never be able to repair it. I graduated 3rd in my class in high school, got into a great college, made A’s for the first year and a half and then it just fell apart. My best friend and the love of my life died of a heroin overdose when I was 19. I never was able to grieve that properly and I ended up flunking out of college, losing my scholarship, and ended up getting into a very emotionally and physically abusive relationship. I got pregnant at 20 by the abusive boyfriend and was able to leave him, but I had to run away and hope that he never found me. I ended up getting married to my now soon to be ex husband when I was 21 while I was 6 months pregnant with my son. (Yes he knew it wasn’t his). We were together up until last month when I finally decided that I couldn’t handle the cheating anymore. My son and I had to move back in with my parents which is a nightmare and I am not ungrateful for them taking us in, but the constant reminder of how I failed and never did anything with my life is killing me. My 20s sucked the life right out of me.

depression,Life sucks,"I 17m have a headache condition undiagnosed and I'm a researcher and medical NERD, so my doctor is misdiagnosing me. I am working to write evidence for what I think it is and it was highly suspected to be iih. My head always hurts, I'm tired and always unhappy. I use lifting weights to try to help and it does, but not like it used to. I have nothing, no job, no cash , not many friends, no car, no talent, no skill. My family struggles in the ways of togetherness and fairness. My parents hate each other but still stay together, and they spy on each other everyday and try to get me and my siblings into it to help them, and out of the 4 of us, they support my mom and I try to be neutral. I'm tried of life and tired of no love, and teenage years. It's been garbage since 2 years ago and it sucks. My dad is obsessed with a woman out side so he rarely talks, but he pays bills, but very late and always spends money on stupid shit. My mom sees me as an annoying as hell boy who is following his dad's footsteps of neglecting family and other shit. I care for my family, I try, I really do, I use my limited money of only $175 to fix up the house and get some meds. We are not poor, but we don't have much house money other than basics, my dad does the rest, but he has been ignoring those things and leaves us as a family of 6 with $1,000. It sounds like a lot, but food, cleaning and cloths cost a lot of 6 people. Beyond my huge family problem my mom still does not like me and always likes my other siblings, even though I do more than them and have x3 the amount of chores than them. I'm tired of it but I'm yelled at and berated. So I must - vacuum an entire floor, vacuum small spaces when called, dust a room, clean a bathroom, mop the stairs, dry mop the stairs, pick up my dad's clothes off the floor everyday, odd jobs I must respond to, change the water machine, and must be ready for any callout. I'm tired of this. I never got to enjoy my teen years and bought 18 will be any different. Never went out, never did anything fun in the summer, always stayed home 365 days, went to the gym in the summer for the first time ever. Now, school is started I have nothing. I am tired of always having the same routine for 17 years straight, I'm done, I'm irritable as I have headaches and tired of everything, while everyone around me drives, has fun, has a relationship, the whole package! I want a gf so badly, I'm dying to take care of someone and to love someone and have them tell me I helped them and they love me. I'm tired of never having anyone to be with. It's not fair, I'm responsible with near all A's. But no, I don't get to have these things. On top of all that and my stress, I never in the 17 years of existence got to try a new hairstyle. My mom likes it in only 1 way, I BEG to change it as I hate it and it makes me sad and mad along with making me feel ugly, I've tried being nice about it I've tried it all, I never have gotten to change it. She just yells and called it ugly and always says I'm stupid. I hate my life, I want to be better religion wise as well, but I've fallen off. I wanna go back in, get money, and help everyone around me and take care of people that are not happy. I used to love helping people, now I judge everyone silently and everyone hates me on sight. Im ugly as hell, but think I look good with My hair more wavy and flat and glasses
It makes me feel so happy, but it only last a few weeks, before I have to look at my ugliness. I also hate how everyone calls me stupid, my mom calls me stupid and an idiot everyday, and she always yells at me for the little things, while she does yell at my siblings, it is no where near how bad it is for me. 24/7, I know she might be unhappy but, I have my life because of the way I get no one, and no support. I want someone just to care for and give them my everything so I have a purpose. I just want to love someone and have them love me. I want to have my hair choise, even just for once in my life, and maybe try something cool. I never got to drive or do anything special. I was in such a rush to grow up as I always imagined going hunting or fishing or trying something new. Now it feels it all a waste. I have no one, I am no one, and no one wants me. I hate life, but I don't want to die just yet, just wanna go far enough to do good deeds and help struggling people, and die when I can do enough to get to heaven not hell. I just hate how everyone around me feels ahead and so happy in their life. While I hate myself and everything I never got to do. I am special as I always give 150 not just 100. I love surprising people and making them happy, so when someone gives me a task, I don't do the minimum, I go to the max to make them happy, not for a thank you. But that's been wasted for now, as I have no one to make happy. I do robotics at school and 3d printing and design at home ad a hobby.

depression,Seems like this is the end of the rope,"I have realized how utterly useless and hopeless I am as far as getting employed is concerned. I used to have a great prospect, about 11 years ago when I completed my Masters in Computer Sciences and was applying myself passionately into becoming a full fledged passionate developer. But life had other plans for me and it has been throwing one curve ball after another at me. Extreme health concerns within family made me stray way off course and devote 100% of my time and energies into managing the conditions of parents at home. Years went by... perhaps I should have tried harder to get back into the game and get myself some solid job or some crappy job or anything at all. But NO, I just didn't have any energy left after all the time/physical and mental energy I was already spending.

From 2013 to 2021 were the most unproductive years of my life, I wasted it all. Then just as I was trying to recollect myself and applying myself again, life threw another curve ball and my mother got severe brain hemorrage, the months and years which followed that went by like a blur because every day was such a crisis event.

The finances at home are almost exhausted now, I have been trying again to recollect myself and do something, anything for anyone... to somehow use the skills and knowledge I had and have been learning again... but I seem to have no real practical experience in the tech world. My only real-world skill is in taking extremely good care of critically ill person, but I have no interest in making this my career and the career which I was once passionate about and still passionate about, is so far out of my grasp I might as well just give up.

I feel like I am neck deep in the quick sand and try as I might, I am going deeper with no hopes of rescuing myself from this situation and now only the peaceful abyss awaits.

Not ever bc they actually wanted to spend time with me. 
And yk for a long time i was alright with it, like wtf am i gonna do??? I was jst grateful they at least sometimes talked to me. What really fucking hurt tho, was when i realized not even my ex truly wanted me bc he loved me or some shit like that. I hate being vulnerable with people and so it was really big for me to tell him the things i did, and i shared so much with him. And it was great at first but slowly he started crying about how much he missed his ex and kept comparing me to her. Always mentioning things she used to do. I cannot even fucking describe how much that shit broke me. Like completely killed me inside. I thought for once in my life i had someone who truly wanted me for me and loved and cared about me but nope, the only reason he needed me to stay with him was because i was his personal therapist. Literally for an entire year of our relationship it was just me trying to get him not to kill himself. And so ig he became really reliant on me and didn’t know what he’d do with himself if i left.

I said again, how would I do that if I have no will to live, no ambitions, no motivation to go on and would quite literally rather kill myself instead. How he responded? ""Do you want to be hospitalized again?"", turned off the call and went to sleep.

You know what? FUCK YOU, FUCK YOUR USELESS MEDS, what the fuck am I supposed to do?! To just all of a sudden decide to try to live when I literally don't want to?

depression,Antidepressants.,"Hi !
I go to a psychiatrist ( 4 sessions so far) , I am depressed and have suicidal thoughts.
I have already been on antidepressants 5 years ago and I have attempted an overdose ( unfortunately it didn’t work).
And I told him about it so he said we will work without it.
But it’s been getting worse, and he suggested it again and I told him that I will for sure try something if I have access to it.

Is it possible to actually die from antidepressants ??

I am suffering and I do wanna disappear.
I haven’t told my dr ( I dont wanna be put in a center or something )
but lately I have been trying to get intoxicated with gaz ( I close all the windows when I take my shower ) hoping it will do something but nothing so far,  it’s not effective.

What should I do ? Thanks",0.068,0.174,0.758

depression,I feel all alone,"I know that it is not true, I have a number of friends whom all went to different cities, I cant get along with people at college(also due to me almost being non existent there). I have a girlfriend of 1.5 years, the relationship itself is good in most ways, but due to different colleges we have a distance with eachother. We can only see eachother once a week, sometimes less. 

This feeling have turned into depression, I disnt feel happines much in my life but this is the worst I have felt in my life. It has been like this ever since college started(almost a year). I get up on time mostly but my head tries so hard to just find excuses to stay in bed. I find myself staying in the bed, sometimes sleeping and sometimes just staring at the wall only to regret what I have done and hate myself more and morr every second.

Worst part is that I am luckier than most; long relationship, living alone rent free(my dad pays it), some deal of friends I can almost always call(I never do), I have some financial problems but I do my best to manage it, if I just found a job and worked a while it would be solved but I also cant get myself to do that either. I am not doing any responsibility I have, and hate myself over it. 

I also nave nyctophobia, had it ever since I was a kid, but it became serious since 2 months ago. I have been forced to sleep with lights on for the last 2 weeks. Sometimes I just wait for dawn to sleep, because I hate sleeping with lights on. 

I so rarely text to my girlfriend about my mental state, and never to my friends. Not because they wouldn't understand but I just feel guilty that I am killing their mood as they love their life. Also when I do talk most they can do is ""its gonna be alright"". Day after talking I watch them cathing a beer with friends while I am on my pc, killing time all by myself. Don't get me wrong, I am  jeolus but not hateful, I do feel happy for them which is exactly why I cant share my sickness with them.

It hurts so much to carry around all these tears, it adds not to the weight of my being but the weight of my soul. I mourn for the boy i used to be. Before the stigma was ingrained that “real men don’t cry” but what is a real person who doesn’t express all the real emotions that we feel. No one knows i feel this way, except my own self conscience. I try so hard to be the best me i can be, to be free of any sadness, pain, discontent. But for that to happen MY tears need to be shed. To be put out into the world. I need comfort. I NEED a shoulder to cry on. But i have none. So i shall mourn on in silence, until i cannot hold back my pain and my suffering.

depression,Just words about my paradox,"I'm putting this out there so that I could vent / figure out what to do with myself.

At every point in my life I've never had my own thoughts. I had dreams as a kid, and they faded away as I grew older as I'm sure a great deal of people can relate.

My problem is that from an early age, I've wanted to die. Like how some kids want to become astronauts or doctors or firemen, I wanted to end my life. No one has ever really given me reason not to save for my father, the only person I can confidently say loves me and I him. It's been a very weird and difficult way to go on.

Due to childhood trauma and most likely genetic heritage I have double depression. When it hits, it hits hard and for a loving time. Some very few times I snap out of it and I find life shockingly easy to live. Things take almost no energy to do and I can clearly think/execute tasks and plans. It makes me realize just how disadvantaged I am when I'm back in my episodes.

I don't know if anyone in my life truly understands how I get through my days, much less the paradox of needing to live but really wanting to die. Sometimes I have the strength to motivate myself and grit through the hard times. Other times not so much.

I have a lot of rumination about the things people close to me have done or said. Things like I'll never amount to anything, to cheating, to full on fights, and s/a.

The gnarled stuff earlier in my life, I've almost forgotten. It almost feels like myth.

I don't see myself having much time left. Kind of like circling a drain, or having contractions before birth. I feel terrible but that's par for the course. I don't feel regretful, angry, sad, or happy about death. If anything, it just feels appropriate, like picking a path at an intersection.

I've made a lot of people happy. Some I've betrayed. Some I've let walk over me. I haven't seen the world. A lot of people have surpassed me in milestones that I feel I should have/could have attained had I not listened to those wiser than myself.

I just couldn't get the ball rolling on life.

I have always been outcasted because of that, and I'm tired of it.

Autism is not a superpower the way I have heard it be. No. Autism will never be a plus in anyone's life, but a struggle to keep and conform with the right people. Your pool of friendships and romantic partners (if they exist at all), will forever be reduced. In such a case, who in their right mind would wish to be autistic? The truth is, nobody wants to be one. All across the slide of the spectrum, autism is a disease, and no twinkering, no masking, no faking it 'til you make it will prove this curse otherwise.

The amount of social interaction I have lost because of this has been a spear piercing through my abdomen. I have been nailed to this disease for my entire life, and everyone treats me like a pariah. I have never had anyone I can love because my behaviours are so abnormal and out of the average. But it would be good if I was a savant, at least. You know, to be extraordinarily skilled at something, a genius. But autism and genius are as far apart as antonyms can be.

They are not compatible, just like heaven is to hell as being a socialite is to autism.

I received an unhealthy amount of bullying during my formative years just because I was not like them. I was never welcomed anywhere. And when I displayed some sort of knowledge about a certain subject, I was used like a tool for their advantage. I was not cared like a human being, and up to this point, I feel sub-human.

There is creature vaguely human when I look in the mirror. Its voice is that of an animal mimicking speech, but failing to do so. It tries to appear human, and continues to mirror their behaviours, their words, their demeanour, but fails nonetheless; it does not understand the meaning of it all, but the mere outward expressions. You cannot make a clock work by simply plastering some metal pieces, painting twelve lines on a circle, and pasting two sticks on top of each other.

I am depressed because I was never treated like a human being. I am depressed because I am not normal. I am depressed because I could never love and be loved.

It is anger, it is sadness, it is disappointment, it is confusion. It is despair, it is misery, it is torture.

It never gets better. It never will. Trying to find like-minded individuals who would appreciate me is like trying to find this unique grain of sand on the whole sea floor.

depression,Don't have energy to socialize,"Hello,

As everyone knows, mothers day coming up this weekend. However, I have absolutely no energy to go out for dinner tomorrow night. I don't want to not go, but I feel so badly about myself.

The past year my depression has been getting worse, Ive been self isolating as a result of a decrease in self confidence as I gained 30 pounds this past year. Ive been avoiding seeing friends because I feel ashamed. I used to go gym regularly and was extremely fit, but now I am not. 

How do I get out of a state like this, where i can find energy to gym and eat well, maintain a social life, do school and work. It feels like theres so much I need to do, even though back then it was the bare minimum. Does anyone have any advice. Should I go dinner tomorrow or turn it down? Thank you so much.

depression,Depressed and Lonely - Rant Probably,"This is my way of venting I guess. Im just super sad deep down. I suffer from a health issue that makes it difficult to live normal life. I guess it would classify as a disability. I graduated from uni recently and now I want to get a job for which only the highly qualified get. I guess I'll be lonely throughout my life because no woman would want a frail and sickly guy. I kind of live because my mom supports me. She is really the epitome of God for me. Without her I would have no one in this brutal world. I everyday see her smile and feel reassured that there is some meaning to my existence. But change coming around and I dont know what to do. I often look back to a good time in my life which stopped when I was diagnosed with a condition that technically made my life hell all of 2019 to now. I look at my mom, who is a single woman and a brave lady who worked hard and stood on her own feet, sacrificed every bit of her life and happiness for me to have a good life, took loans for my education and made me the man I am today. She inculcated in me the values which are family heirlooms, respect for elders, austerity, simplicity etc all of which were passed down from my maternal grandfather and grandmother who were truly honest and simple natured individuals loved by all. 

With such good natured people all around, I want to get a well paying job with which I can repay the debts I owe to my mother. I see her smile everyday and I want her to be forever happy. I wanted to join the military but I guess now with my health problem, I would be disqualified. I do not know what to do. I feel sickly most of the time. I nearly failed an entire college semester because of health problems. Sometimes I just cry when alone at night but there is this sorrow inside of me which is so intense along with the fear of my future that I cannot feel happy. My mother wants me to have a happy family and get married to a beautiful girl etc etc but I know that that is impossible now. I have opted for voluntary celibacy, I guess that makes me feel better about myself. I have often been suicidal but I dont do it because I am always reminded of my mother's smile, the only person who cares for me.

Everday I experience no emotion at all - I look at pretty women, find it useless, I see at happy people - find it useless, look at rich showing off - find it useless. Only the socially outcast know how brutal the world is. The happy faces are like a facade. I barely have college friends, I have no one to talk to all day. No one to approach to say play sports with, cannot over strain myself because it worsens my health related issues.

  
This was me. Thank you if you read the entire post.

I don’t feel depressed (nor do I actually have depression— I was only ever diagnosed with anxiety and haven’t felt remarkably anxious recently), but every time I describe this to someone, they always bring up depression as a possibility. 

When I say I have no motivation for anything, I mean for ANYTHING. I’m in college and I have “my entire life ahead of me”, but I don’t care for having a job, a marriage, kids— I am cognitively aware that putting effort into my life would, without fail, benefit me both now and in the future. I just don’t care about the benefits. I’m not totally emotionless, or anything like that, but the emotions I do experience (normal happiness, sadness, anger, etc.) feel blunt and temporary. They inspire nothing from me— no happy experience influences me to pursue similar experiences that replicate that happiness; no sad experiences influence me avoid them, either. I don’t have FOMO at all. It’s a very boring and neutral life. I don’t put effort into anything at all. I’m acute aware that I might regret this, but all of my previous passions are so temporary and amount to nothing.

Under my familys demand i did some of the biggest mistake and that mistake made me so miserable and mentally fucked up guy that now even death doesnt scare me.
In the name of helping my family i started taking loans from my friends and relatives at the age of 18 and that debt has piled up so much so that ig i will never be able to pay them off. I work at small coorporate job and my whole income goes at paying the interest of that debt and when i come home after a hard day i want to hear some good things from my family but all i get to witness is family feud. My whole life i have seen my dad and mom fighting each other. People say money cant buy happiness and i know mpney may not be enough to make you feel all the happiness and make you feel complete but money is the most crucial thing to tie your relationahip together.

Those people from whom i took debt earned it thru their sweat and blood at least before dying i want to pay them off. I just want to vanish from the face of the earth, even my whole existence has been pain and failure. People tell me go for therapy, take medication etc but in my country its so fuckin expensive that i never considered it an option.

Hi, I’m F25. So this is the story.. I feel frustrated, upset, sad about the constant comments from my mom regarding my appearance. Every time I gain weight, she feels the need to point it out, telling me to watch what I eat and exercise more. Whenever I return home from the city where I study, first she looks at me from head to toe commenting on whether I've lost or gained weight. Sometimes I avoid eating too much in front of her to prevent her commenting that I don’t need to eat that much. Even when I have pimples on my face, she’s like “what is happening to your face again, you should eat more healthier, you should drink less alcohol, you should exercise more” I'm already aware of all these things, I can see myself in the mirror, my whole life I’m worried about my body, bcs I can gain weight easily and lose it easily, also, I am insecure about it..(she knows that) but her constant criticism only makes it harder for me. I've told her several times how much it bothers me, but she always insists she's doing it for my own good, questioning why I'm so sensitive about it.. 

And btw, she is a bit overweight so she tells me all the time that she’s telling me all that bcs she don’t want for me to be like her.. I don’t know, but that makes me feel so uncomfortable, bad, sometimes I cry bcs of that as well…

depression,My wife of 12 years told me she does not want kids. ,"We were fencesitters for a very long time when it came to kids, we enjoyed life and wasn't sure if we was willing to give that up.

depression,Chronophobia,"TW time

Prison neurosis.

I spend every waking hour thinking about time, trying to force myself to ""just accept it"" but nothing works. I think about how fast and forgettable a year is or how I'm ""only X age once"" to the point where I don't know how to enjoy anything anymore. I'm extremely hyperaware of each passing minute. It's too exhausting to eat, shower, work (not that I ever worked to begin with), or talk with family. I can't ""live in the moment"" because a moment is gone before it even happens. I can't ""make memories"" because memories just remind me of what will never ever happen again. My memories are limited. All feel fake, most in 3rd person. I can’t remember a lot. Are my memories even real? More often than not after doing something I'll suddenly realize ""you'll never have that exact moment again, and you won't remember it."" I can't even play games or watch TV without constantly thinking ""one day you will never do this again, one day this will be irrelevant, one day it will be as if this never existed, etc."" On the rare occasion I ""enjoy"" something, I'll stop and think ""is this enjoyment? If this is as far as it feels then existing doesn't seem worth it."" I also think I have existential OCD and DP/DR (not trying to self diagnose). These eyes are not my eyes, this body is not my body. I'm but a voice trapped in a cage with no doors, windows, or walls. It's like I am trapped in an AI generated world. I don’t feel human. Everyone else is an NPC. I don't feel from this world. I’ll look at literally anything (or nothing) and just get so scared because it feels like I’m trapped behind a movie. I “see” in 1st person but everything going back to a mere second ago is in 3rd person. Time “stopped” when I was a toddler and I can’t get it back. I don’t want to move forward, I just want time back. I can’t keep up. I don’t want to exist. I don’t feel like I exist. I don’t feel like anyone else exists. If “life” is a game where you learn, reproduce, grieve and then die in 5 seconds then I don’t want to be here for it. There's so much more I fear about time but can't put it into the right words. I hate how our brains can comprehend things we can't put into words.

I look at humans going about their lives and wonder how they either haven't realized the reality of time or how they ignore it. I'm envious of them, but at the same time I don't understand them. I don't feel human anymore. I was ""homeschooled"" my entire life. I wonder if I hadn't been ""homeschooled""/isolated my whole life would it have been easier? I've been a NEET since 13 and I had nobody to grow up with. The world aged while I didn't. Nobody but my aging mother to speak to for years and years. I don't understand how my mom isn't depressed from the reality of time. I feel insane, and I don't want to live (whatever that means), but no one cares because it's not a ""physical disability."" Now a chunk of time has suddenly disappeared, and it will continue to disappear.

Sometimes I think I'm not scared of dying. I am, but I'm more scared of the fact that my generation will one day be the oldest alive. One day nobody from the 1900s will exist. They will never exist ever again. One day people will think of the 1920s as they do the 1720s. One day my mom won't be here, my pets won't be here, things I like won't be here, as if they never existed. I think I can hold out for about 2 more years, but it doesn't matter how soon I die. Mom would be sad, but nothing seems real anymore anyway. Would her sadness be real? I stay up really late because I don't want tomorrow, and sleep a lot because I don't want today. I pray so hard that I don’t wake up. All while stupidly crying and begging some nonexistent being to pause or rewind time. I just want my mom to hold me in a pocket of paused time forever.

I don't have any goals. I don't want to have a career or fall in love or have kids or retire because it all feels fake. I can't even fathom existing to an age where those would happen. And remembering that none of those would happen until years later is extremely scary. None of those goals seem worth living for. They'd all be met and gone in the blink of an eye. I can't function. I have anxiety attacks constantly and am constantly exhausted. I’ve paid attention to what I think about and it’s ALWAYS about time, unless I am asleep (I mean that very literally). Sometimes I just collapse while standing from thinking about it. I want to go back. I want to go home. I want to convince my mom to put me in public school. I want to be a little kid forever. I was born yesterday yet have lived 100 years. If there's anything I've learned from chronophobia, it's not to judge someone else's triggers even if they sound weird, because now I get anxiety attacks whenever I read or speak any word related to time (even writing this). I can't look at numbers or dates or clocks or ages or other similar things without feeling suicidal.

And now that I've written that, I'll never get to write it again.

It’s like I know what I need to do to feel ok, but the steps to even start those things feel impossible, and my outlook towards even wanting to get any better has gone way down. ",0.139,0.091,0.771

depression,How do I go on,"Hi, I have been struggling with depression my entire life, I have been committed aswell as medicated. I have never felt like I belonged anywhere. I grew up in an abusive household and now after 22 years of life I have absolutely 0 accomplishments under my belt. I dropped out of high school and got a bs homeschool diploma. I dropped out of college and never went back. I never got my drivers license because every time I get behind the wheel I get a sense of power that scares me, because in the back of my mind I have a voice telling me to wrap it around a tree. My father died a year ago and it left me conflicted. After a lot of self reflection I realized my father loves me but wanted to put me down. He was an Ivy League graduate who put lots of pressure on his children to be amazing, but not better then him leaving almost all of us in a strange insecure limbo.  In the end he tried but it was too little too late.  Before his passing I was in college during I would say the worst year of my life. I had a dying father, 0 friends, and a major I lost complete interest in.  I had a jaw infection and went to the on campus medical facility. During the checkup I asked about seeing a mental health specialist and was informed that was only for people who needed it. Convincing myself afterwards that I did not need help and I was fine. Jump a month or so in the future and I got in contact with a hometown therapist who tells me i need to be on some form of medication otherwise she is going to send me to an institution. I agree and so I get on meds for the first time in my life. I forgot the name but it was too regulate my dopamine levels bringing them to a more normalized state instead of ups and downs. This medication sends me absolutely spiraling the first day I take it I’m completely manic I am all over the place, insane. In a panicked state I call my therapist and she tells me to call my doctor who thinks I might be bipolar at this point and gives me lithium. Over the next month I become incredibly emotional crying at random intervals becoming angry for no reason and decided fuck meds I’m going to hurt myself or someone else if this continues. I failed my first semester and was given a second chance although I ended up blowing that too when i decided to go home to spend my fathers final month with him. 
This was just the last year, I was sent to a hospital during high school and was officially diagnosed with depression with possible intent to self harm. Nothing came of that though because my little shit self lied my way through the hospital out of fear of being stuck there. 
Since my fathers passing I have not done anything I live at home with my mother who is trying to help me but I’m not accepting help. I tried getting my license again but got that same irking feeling that I’m only one bad day away. I don’t trust myself, I fucking hate myself, I torture myself every single day it doesn’t matter what people tell me I always convince myself that I am a miserable fuckup who will never succeed or manage to get better. I know this post seems like a complete pity party and in a way it might be I feel like I take comfort in convincing myself I’m a lost cause because then I don’t have to try anymore. I don’t know what to do anymore. I sit almost catatonic everyday. The only reason I’m writing this is because I’m extremely caffeinated, and being caffeinated or sleep deprived are the only times I feel like doing anything. 

I did skip a lot of stuff but if anyone needs to know more I will try to answer any questions.

Some day when my mother dies I dont know what I am going to do, i'll likely become homeless because I dont have anywhere else I can go.

depression,Suicide notes and my situation. ,"I am taking a trip starting tomorrow and it was finals week this past week. When I can bury myself in stuff it makes dealing with my thoughts easier. I have been suicidal for months and my attempt a little bit ago didn't work. Last Thursday my girlfriend came out to me and said she thinks she doesn't see a future with a man. Even though she loves me she is sure enough that it wouldn't be the right decision to stay with me as her feelings grow stronger. This made finals week hard and we have had a lot of conversations since. I will be down there for ten days (we are long-distance and I leave tomorrow). It was supposed to be good. School over, time with my gf, her prom, our two years, and other stuff we had planned. Then when I came back I could focus on work, do some more for my mental health, and have her until she goes away for a month. I am aware this trip has the potential to make me come back in a completely wrecked mental state but it is already bought, planned, and committed to. 

The people who know are afraid or worried I might attempt. My girlfriend even put off telling me because she thought I might attempt. 

I have been taking my Adderall and Mood Stabilizers and although it has helped I have been able to think and focus and I just still feel like I want to die. The situation might be an add on but also I feel I was a shitty bf, a terrible sibling, shitty friend, and I know my family is unhappy I'm trans and it has been 3 years. I am on testosterone now and my mom cried because of it. I am unhappy in my body. I try going to the gym but it is hard without a car. Doing work outs at home doesn't work for the same reason I can't do HW at home. Too distracting. All of that plus my desire to die. The thought in my head that I will come back from the trip and attempt soon after has made me incredibly...happy? On my Adderall, I don't show emotion well but I have been finding all the bad stuff going on in my life funny now. Kinda laughing to myself about my situations. I am hopeful my attempt works. I mean I have considered trying to find someone to...take me out. 

Then last night I started writing letters. Writing letters has helped me this week because they were all to my gf. But these letters were for my family. It made me feel ""better"" after awhile like hey maybe it will all be okay. But then I was up late last night talking to my gf and then had to go to work and am now at school working on 3 hours of sleep. Still have to go back to work. I ate half of a big muffin today and I haven't eaten a real meal since last Thursday when I got the news. I feel like I am unsure where I stand now. I feel like I want to be better but I'm worried that's a lie. Maybe I just don't want everyone to be right and I know I don't want my gf to feel like it is her fault. It is my brain. I feel so lost.

depression,What is nostalgia and why does it hurt so bad?,"Just to be clear, I am currently 14, almost 15. Around 3 years ago, I was in a residential mental health program that I lived in for 10 months. The entire place is crooked, to be clear. When you are there, a lot of staff mentally and physically abuse you, such as restraining you for saying a bad word and putting you into the equivalent of solitary confinement where you are banging, screaming, and kicking at the door begging to be let out. The only good thing is you create incredibly strong relationships with the other kids (11 and below), and super close relationships with any staff who actually try to help you and care about you. That was 3 years ago. The crooked part, is they intentionally have you form close relationships and then rip them apart from you as they forbid relationships after leaving with staff members, and they will refuse to give you any information to reach out to the other kids, and when you are 11 you don't think to ask them for their phone number while being there. The way nostalgia works is it makes you glorify the past and it gets worse when you are in a bad situation. The people there that I formed a relationship, I miss them deeply everyday and it has come to the point of essentially stalking them trying to find any info. All I could find on a staff member was their linkedin, but it is pointless because even though I reached out they aren't alllowed to respond. I am considering going to the institution and then talking to them that way, but the problem is that after I reach out it will seem like stalking, especially with the way linked in shows profile views. The kids I met there, one went missing in 2022, and although they were found, any info I could find on them would be buried very deep as all that will come up is articles of them missing. The other kid I miss, his name is incredibly common and I don't even know where to look. I feel depressed constantly and I don't know how to stop thinking about the past and coming up with elaborate but pointless schemes on how to find these people again. I don't know whether talking to them will be a good thing or just make it worse as as soon it is over I will long to talk to them again.

On top of that, I am just very upset with how time works. My parents are fairly old, they had kids late. At best, I probably have 20 years left with them. But that 20 years means nothing, as when they do inevitably die, the 20 years will be over. Like, when I first arrived at that program, I felt it was never going to end and I would be stuck there forever. But here we are 3 years later and it all feels instant. Even writing this, I can never go back to five minutes ago when I started. I don't understand why, but this has been making me more depressed than I already am with my clinical depression.",0.072,0.113,0.815
depression,Is it depression or am I just lazy? ,"I’m 30 years old and a stay at home mom. I love my husband, daughter and dog very much.

depression,I'm having a really bad night,"So I got married in 2017. My godmother which I love so much and she's practically a saint, has multiple sclerosis. She came to my wedding fully happy for me, then I saw her a month afterwards and she expressed the wish to meet my husband. She met him briefly at the wedding, but she actually wanted to get to know him. At that point she was in a wheelchair, but she could move her hands and her brain was great. I said of course, we will arrange to meet! 

Then I was always in my own issues, depressed, anxious etc. So I never actually arranged that. I was always saying to myself, I'll get to it. She sent me a few messages, I responded but that was it. She was always in my heart, and I felt guilty for not reaching out, but my mental health is *so bad* I struggle to convince myself to keep going another day. I ghosted all my friends because I don't have the mental energy to work at any relationship. Then I had my son, and I had post partum anxiety disorder. She didn't reach out, I thought it was my fault because I was so distant. I felt guilty, but still I wasn't at a good place to reach out. I always thought I will do it when I'm better mentally. 

Last month I was talking with my mom, she told me I was invited to the wedding of my Godmother's daughter. My godmother is a really good friend of my mother. I was excited to go and see her in person finally. I expressed my concern that she doesn't ask about me anymore. She said, ""no, she asks about you all the time"". I left it at that. 

Today was the wedding. When I saw her.. I have no words. She was in a terrible state. She doesn't move anymore, and I think she doesn't understand what's going on. I broke down in front of everyone, ugly crying. I almost made my godfather cry as well. I asked him if she understands anything and he said yes, but I'm not sure that's true. I talked to her and her voice was barely audible, and I'm not 100% she understood who I was. I just got out of there immediately because some people saw me and I didn't want to spoil their fun. 

It's been an hour and I'm crying like I've never cried before. It destroyed me. I feel like I'm so selfish and I'm only lost in my own issues and that I'm the worst person to have ever existed. She was such an amazing person to me, she bought me a really expensive dollhouse when I was a kid when my parents barely bought me any toys, because she said nobody gifted her one while she was growing up and she wanted me to have it. 

Now I lost my chance to tell her how amazing she was and how much I love her, she probably thinks I didn't even care and this is why I was distant. I just hate me I'm honestly so broken I was just starting to feel better and take care of myself I just can't take it anymore",0.129,0.176,0.695

But no. I feel so stupid for believing that it was going to get better for me.

depression,Feeling trapped and frustrated with myself,"tw // suicidal ideation

sorry if this is really long and rambly, I'm just feeling utterly awful right now and I need to get it off my chest

24F still doing undergrad compsci. I am officially diagnosed with ADHD. I just got switched to new medication that works. I have generous accomodations. I have parents who support me. I just started therapy and I'm taking a reduced load this sem but I STILL CANT GET MY ACT TOGETHER.

wasted the semester rotting in my room either playing video games or doom-scrolling. I'd tell myself I'd go down to campus to study but I'd spend hours in the morning trying to pull myself together and then it feels like it's too late and I'd just give up for the day and tell myself I'll do better tomorrow AND I DON'T. I'm so frustrated with myself because I see people here on this sub who don't have access to half the support I have and here I am still flunking and doing horribly. I feel as if I've long crossed the ""be understanding of your mental condition"" line and I'm firmly in the ""you're an irresponsible f*ck-up"" zone.

I think I need to take a break and get away from university because I've been trying to brute force this for YEARS and while I've made SOME progress, it's taken a huge toll on me. I'm just 3 or 4 classes away from graduating and I'm already 24 so I don't blame my parents for not wanting me to take a break for a semester but I genuinely feel like I've long gone past the breaking point. I hate uni, I hate doing anything related to my degree even though I used to love programming and most of all I hate myself. I have never felt more trapped and paralyzed in my life and it's making me wish I could just die in my sleep tonight.

on Tuesday I'm going to talk to the course management office to discuss my options but I'm so afraid they'll tell me to just drop out or keep pushing. I don't want to be in university anymore but dropping out feels like the end of the world. I have very few friends and if I drop out I feel like I'd be losing the few I have in uni forever.

I'm also afraid id just end up wasting the break away and not achieving anything. like, I'm so afraid to commit to anything because I've screwed up so much and I'm terrified I'll screw this up to like everything else

Every option seems so utterly bleak and agonizing right now. MAybe it's not that bad but in my head it feels like I have nowhere left to run and that it's truly over. It's like my brain is being crushed from all sides and I can't take it anymore.

if you read all the way to the end, thank you so much. I know it got really dieectionless at the end there but I really needed to get this out because it's eating entire holes in my brain.

depression,What's the point?,"So, my first ever post on reddit an its a morbid one. Not gonna beat around the bush just gonna try an put it all out there.

For as long as I can remember I've been a miserable bastard an have suffered with my mental health. Childhood was shit, full of physical, mental, sexual abuse and the loss of my older brother. My teenage to adolescent years led to drinking, drug taking,fighting and homelessness. My adult years have been isolation, loneliness,drug taking and more homelessness. Never been able to hold a job down and never been in a job I want or enjoy because I fucked up in school an left with nothing to really show for it so the only jobs i get are shitty back breaking jobs for minimum wage. Can't be arsed even trying to go the gym anymore so the belly is growing and I'm developing a cracking pair of man tits. Got no friends, havent had any for years, the only conversation i have with people is at work and i only work 3 days a week. Literally have no idea how to speak to women, if I'm honest I'm scared of them. I lost my virginity at 18 which was a disaster and resulted in me avoiding women until I got my first girlfriend at 30 which only lasted less than a year, probably down to me not being a real man an being a drain on her. Just to clarify on my women issues I'm not an incel I just kind of view myself as just a sexual object for someone else, my abuser would regularly make comments about my small 'manhood' and me being unable to ever please a women with it. Don't get me wrong he was right, it was small and still is. I know I shouldn't let that stop me but anytime I've ever spoken to women or had the want to, my brain just instantly tells me no matter if she even liked me she would see what I'm working with and want nothing to do with me so I don't. Even after having a relationship where that wasn't really a issue its still something I can't get out of my head now that I'm single again. Tried the online dating shite and that isn't for me, had a tinder gold account for the last 3 months and still not even 1 like so maybe just by pictures I give a bad vibe off. The only way I can describe my life is living a life of solitary confinement but in the free world while I get to watch all the normal people doing the things I wish I could.

depression,should i try meds again?,"hello, i‘ve (22F) been anxious and depressed all my life, when i was 20 it reached its peak and i had a massive breakdown, was put on mirtazapine 15 mg due to depression, anxiety and insomnia. helped with depression and anxiety, however it made me gain a lot of weight, felt emotionally numb, gave me brainfog and constant tiredness. withdrawal was horrible, after two months i was fine tho. for about three months things were fine, then negative thoughts and social anxiety came back. i didn’t wanna see my GP for a long time bc i was afraid of what she might say, in the end i went there and she gave me some homeopathic stuff. that was in december 2023. in april 2024 things got worse, at first it was only anxiety, for about a month i‘ve been feeling a mixture of sadness, numbness and panic. there is literally no reason for me to feel that way as i know my life is actually beautiful and things are fine. however i still feel like depression is slowly creeping back into my life and frankly i’m just so sick of it! right now i‘m still able to do everyday tasks, however there’s nothing that brings me joy and i think about dying frequently without no reason.  i have little appetite, feel unmotivated and am constantly tired. i really wanna enjoy life right now and not loose my 20s to depression and anxiety as that’s how my teenage years have been. i‘m just terrified of taking meds again due to sideffects like weightgain, emotional numbness and brain fog. also i don’t wanna become dependent on them, but i also sometimes feel like maybe im just one of these people who need meds to cope with life so idk. any advice would be appreciated ",0.095,0.152,0.753

I said yes, that he took the piss quite a lot with that guy ..

depression,mdd is making my memory suck and my group probably hates me,"note: grammar mistakes. english is my second language so bare with me

tl;dr: struggling w group thesis and acads in general bcos of my mdd. also i think ppl hate ne

hi. im a 2nd yr college student that was previously diagnosed w/ mdd when i was 15. since the beginning of december, i felt like i was relapsing in my old ways and i felt like i was going to go thru another depressive spiral. soon enough, my suspicions came true. i loss motivation to do anything despite being in a course that i love. im still currently battling my depression until now and have gotten help from my professors.

the biggest thing that impacted my mdd was our thesis proposal. i couldnt meet personal deadines and i would often panic before doing anything. now, i recognize that im mostly at fault bcos i dont update them with anything or be open about my problems bcos they're all in the same circle of friends so i figured I'd be rude to suddenly disrupt their friendship dynamic. but after a month, i literally had a full on mental meltdown. we did have a talk w our research professor but even though im slowly improving, i feel like it isnt enough. 

we're currently preparing for our oral defense and for days i spent most of my time familiarizing and reading our paper. we usually schedule mock defenses to be ready but everytime i get asked, i blank out. in my head i kmow the answer, but when i talk it either sounds disorganized or i fully blank out. but i try. i really do. i take notes and everything but it feels like im not doing enough. they commented that i havent answered a single question properly even though i felt like i have, but i understand if it isnt up to their standards. 

im seriously thinking if im bringing them down and if this is all i can give right now. im pretty sure that my behavior is already well known within their circle of friends, that im probably unreliable and hard to work with. but im trying my best. i really am. im just so frustrated with myself since i dont think my efforts are showing. i know i can do better,  but for now this is my best and i dont think its enough. 

i honestly dont know what to do. feel free to leave some advice or some encouragement bcos im seriously at my wits end ",0.17,0.099,0.73
depression,my parents destroyed my life,"I am (20F) and coming from a toxic family. I used to be a very bright student. I was interested in arts and sports and was very active and social. But everything turned upside down…   

My older brother became addicted to drugs when I was a sophomore in high school. He lost his home, his job, and everything. So my dad let him live with us. My brother is narcissistic and violent. He used to beat my father, my mother and me and he even tried to stabbed me once. so I started having panic attacks and stopped trying for anything. I begged my father many times, but he didn’t send my brother away from home. He always chose my brother. 

2 years later we moved to another city because of the problems caused by my brother's addiction. And my family found out that I like girls and they forced me to break up with my girlfriend. A few months after I broke up with my girlfriend, there was a terrible earthquake in the city we used to live in and my girlfriend died. 

I was left alone in a city I knew nothing about, with no friends and no future ahead of me. And it is still like this. I want to go to college but I feel like it is too late for everything. I am so depressed, always in my bed, always crying, can’t get over her or the things my family did to me. I am so angry, so tired, so lost. I don’t know what to do…

depression,I think I might be heavily depressed,"Hi Reddit,

I don't really know what is going on with me but I know I am not my normal self and haven't been for 3 weeks now... (possibly a lot longer) I think I am coming to the realisation that I maybe suffering quite badly from depression.

Some background about me, I am a 24 year old guy, living in Europe who is originally from the United Kingdom. I work in a creative industry and as of last year started working freelance (mostly from home), I am quite highly strung, a people pleaser and a worrier (I hate to let people down, it is one of my biggest fears).. In the last 3 or so weeks it has felt like the way I think has changed completely, rather than being worried about deadlines, work, money etc it has all just stopped. It is like I don't care about anything anymore but I am still self aware enough to keep asking myself ""What the hell is wrong with me, this isn't me, why am I being this way.. Why can I not just do this simple task"".

When I say that I cannot do this simple task, I can't.. For example, I was asked to change some colours for some design work and it has taken me 2 days to do it, which usually would take me 5 minutes. I don't look forward to any kind of future anymore, it is like I am shutting down.. My drinking is almost constant now because I guess I am self medicating (Not getting stupid drunk, but still consuming a lot just to exist).

I wanted to ask you if you can relate? It feels like the world now is a very draining place and I just feel like I am shutting down and getting ready to hang up the jacket and call it a day.. This sucks and I wish I knew what was going on (but even trying to action that is like climbing a mountain, i.e. this has taken me 4 hours to write)

depression,hear me out,"Without discussing this with anyone or reading in psychology or any science of that sort I came to a conclusion that by setting things up earlier spares you a huge effort to fix a tiresome situation with people.   
  
  
  
A good example is realizing and being conscious that you have to wear a smile on your face, be authentic and original not classic\\fake and formal, have a cheerful attitude, speak up, eye contact all people in the meeting, be loud but not too loud to be considered present.  
   
  
  
All that will spare you too much brain work of regret and frustration later specially if you were an empath with a broken emotional system (sarcastically).

depression,Is anyone up?,"I also have ADHD along with major depressive disorder with psychotic features and OCD and extreme PTSD plus anxiety and most likely some sort of panic disorder but I wanted to post here because I want to reach as many people as possible because I really really need as much support as possible.

Basically my current psychiatrist comes to the local mental health clinic only once a week and the rest of the time there is no way to get into contact with him if you have an emergency. Even when he IS there the receptionist will only take a very brief message and you never end up getting a call from the doctor. I have had panic attacks off and on for many years. I will have them for a while then they will dissappear for up to months or even years then out of nowhere come back worse than ever. Well I recently began to have panic attacks again after several years of not having them and this time around the panic attacks are so extreme that I feel like I am literally about to absolutely go insane because I literally cannot withstand the feeling and I feel like passing out. 

So I asked my life partner-- God bless him because he is the sweetest and most helpful and kindest person ever-- to help me search online for a psychiatrist that has good reviews and seems like they may be a very kind and very helpful psychiatrist. So we are working on that and we are also working on finding one that I can speak to as soon as possible-- whether online through video chat or in person though online is much preferable but obviously not necessary. I need a psychiatrist who is very kind and very very helpful and who is much more available for his patients in the case of an emergency. 

The problem is-- I'm afraid that I may have to go through multiple psychiatrists before I find one that will actually take me seriously and do right by me and get my medications right. The problem is with that is that I literally cannot withstand much more of these panic attacks-- I cannot express that enough. I used to be prescribed Klonopin and Ativan for my panic attacks and those medications were the only treatments that ever helped at all. I need my medication again for emergencies when I have panic attacks that I cannot handle on my own and I need it as soon as possible. But what if this first psychiatrist that I end up seeing does not give me my medication? That is my biggest concern since I literally cannot withstand or endure these panic attacks and I don't see how I could possibly go through much more of these panic attacks. I am having panic attacks about once per day and they last for several hours. But I cannot think about the whole what if thing right now. I just need to focus on what needs to be done now which is finding a psychiatrist who has really good reviews that heavily imply that they are a very kind and very very helpful mental health professional and then getting an appointment for as soon as possible with that psychiatrist. 

So anyways... There is my update for now. Thank you to everyone who commented on my last post. At the present time I could really use your advice or comments or thoughts or if you want to you could share what you have been up to lately or share something about you or share your mental health story with me. I would really really love that! Especially hearing your stories-- definitely including the success stories because those comfort me and remind me that I  will soon feel better and get better and that it does get better because it is honestly extremely difficult to see that right now which absolutely scares the mess our of me literally more than words can possibly express. 

I hope some of you are still up because I love responding to people and talking to them. My entire mental state-- especially due to my panic attacks and how literally extreme and LITERALLY unbearable they are but also due to my depression issues and all of the feelings the depression has been causing me AND also due to my obsessive compulsive disorder ESPECIALLY the literally nonstop intrusive thoughts and how extreme those issues are-- well anyways my point is all of these issues that I am struggling with by far the most have absolutely destroyed my mind over the past days or weeks and has massively destroyed my mind's ability to function even somewhat normally so I have been either unable to sleep at night or have just not felt up to sleeping at all. 

So anyways if you have actually read this far thank you SO much because that genuinely means a lot to me. Alright well if anyone has any thoughts or comments or if anyone wants to share what they have been up to lately or if anyone wants to share something about themselves or share their stories-- especially success stories-- then I would love to hear it and I encourage it!!!!!

depression,I shouldn’t be depressed but I am. ,"So I’ve been ‘depressed’ (only past few years I’ve actually been diagnosed by a therapist) since I was 15/16 and Im 21 now. I have a job I’ve held down for 3 years, which is a shitty one at best but I like the social interactions it brings. In college for the past 6 months, try to eat healthy every now and then, have a shower everyday, clean up after myself and have a proper clean of my room every week, have some friends and even in therapy. But I still just have an overwhelming desire to jump in front of a bus and end everything every single morning and night. All i truly want in this world is to die. I go to sleep nearly every night writing a suicide note in my head. 

The only person that knows is my therapist. Everyone else sees me as a happy, laidback guy whose biggest problem is procrastinating and being lazy. It’s like I’m wearing a mask that I’ve gotten so used to wearing I don’t even know how to not use it when I leave the house. 

My next hope is joining a gym, my ex broke up with me a few months ago so it seems fitting aswell. But I’ve also been saying I’d join for the past year so in all likelihood I won’t but I do want to. ",0.187,0.112,0.7
depression,Reporting psychiatrist ,"I am so upset about the last psychiatrist that I had. She was incompetent. I have bipolar disorder and take medication for it. Last year, I decided to get proper treatment for my disorder through therapy and medication management. At first, everything was great, we got along very well and I felt like I had finally found a provider who understood me. Things quickly turned for the worse when she prescribed me a medication that triggered a manic episode. She didn’t listen to me when I told her that I felt like I was going into a manic episode. I ended up having to stay at a mental hospital because I kept walking/pacing every day and couldn’t stop.

In hindsight, I should have stopped seeing her then, but I wanted to give her another chance. After my stay at the hospital, I was prescribed a sleep medication along with lithium. The lithium brought down my blood sugar and I would wake up craving juice, smoothies, and soda. I was also affected by diabetes insipidus, which is a temporary condition where you drink a ton of water. I told my psychiatrist about this and after much pleading, she took me off of lithium. Now, I am pre diabetic and I suspect that it’s because of the time when I couldn’t stop drinking sugary beverages. I wasn’t even close to being pre diabetic before then. 

The sleep medication worked at first, but recently triggered a psychotic event where i attempted suicide. I told my psychiatrist that I was feeling suicidal and she suggested that I go back to inpatient, which didn’t help at all. I did end up going to inpatient and my meds were finally adjusted. I feel much better now but I’m disappointed that I risked my health by going on all of these medications. 

As for therapy, she wasn’t qualified to treat patients with PTSD and I knew this before, but the way she addressed my trauma was awkward and dismissive. We spent 20 minutes of a session just talking about the gym even though the gym was not a priority for me. 

With all that being said, I would like to report my former psychiatrist because of the low standard of care that I received over the course of six months. I have no idea where to start with this process. I also “feel bad” about reporting because I’m sure she didn’t do any of this intentionally, the aftermath was beyond her control, however, she should have listened to me when I made complaints about the adverse effects.

I will say some things that I have been going through recently and can you pls help me. 

1. I have lost all interest in what I used to like, mainly playing games, this starts about 3 months ago and has persisted throughout. I now just feel lost and don't know what do to. I try to do as much school work as possible but sometimes I just can't so I sit and do nothing

2. I'm always sad and unenthusiastic to the point that my family is starting to notice. I also have been told that I have been getting short tempered recently by multiple people.

3. I have lost my appetite to the point where I am forced to eat.

4. I have been having thoughts of ending for a while now but they recently developed into urges, idk if that's normal.

Is this indicative that I have depression? Thanks for all the help.

depression,One of my teachers is concerned for me...,"(using a throwaway cuz I want to keep my main account positive)

So, these last few months have been the worst months of my life. I'm only 16 and in high school. Essentially, a variety of situations and events have led to me feeling so shit. I can't believe it's possible to be this sad and hopeless. Every day gets worse, I'm so insecure, I hate myself, I hate my life, I have no close friends due to isolating myself and trust issues, I get so anxious and stressed it's unbearable, I count calories, my grades are dropping, I feel like nothing, I don't like my interests anymore, I feel so disconnected from myself and the world.

The last couple days it must've been showing, cuz i got around 5 are you okays from friends and teachers. But today (which has been my worst day yet) my English teacher asked me if I'm okay. Idk why but I said yes. I'm scared for what will happen if I admit it. She said if I needed to talk I could talk to her. Later on, she came up to me and asked if I was sure, and if I was talking to anyone (I said no), and she said she was concerned about me. At the end of the lesson she said she hoped my day would be okay. It felt a little nice, but honestly it scares me.

depression,Please help me. I'm scared what I might do in the future . ,"So yea here I am to rant about how shit my father is because he can't take in my opinion . At first I used to think that he was actually right and I'm an asshole who doesn't love his parents for what they do for me but as I grew I started to understand things and started to feel that maybe I'm not the problem but I couldn't express it and with constant pressure from my dad to be like my twin brother (this was till I was 18 years old) and says that I should drink the water that's was used to wash other people children so that I might get some intelligence from it. He used to straight up say I was a dissapointment to him the moment I was born and I should be grateful to him because he take care of me which I am but why should I always listen to him saying shit about me? 

I'm 24 years old now and this behaviour has become worse as years pass by . He has been a ticking time bomb and I have tried to change him by showing love but all that is for the waste because once his mood goes bad he just forgets everything and just straight up start to say shit about me and how much of a dossapointment and an asshole I am. 

There was this one time when he came to Kerala (that's our native place, all my family members are at Dubai except me because he said he doesn't have enough money to bring me to Dubai, which is a lie because if he wanted to he could bring me there but doesn't and forced me to work in India for an year) I picked him up and he just started to complain the way I overspeed (I was going 60kmh at the road where 90 is the limit) and started to get angry for each and every single thing I did while I drove. He suddenly said he wanted to go to a specific restaurant (which passed by 15mins ago) and I asked him to check on Google map which he acted as if he didn't heard and continued to scroll through facebook (fuck you facebook your misinformation posts is one of the reason my father is like this)  I started to ask him twice and thrice and finally I took my own phone to check and he suddenly shouted saying da fuck are you even doing ? Why da fuck can't stop staring at the phone for a single minute ? I camly replied to him that he didn't heard me maybe because he was looking at the phone so I was about to put on Google map to the restaurant . He just straight shouted at me for being an incompetent driver and ranted on how useless and asshole I was . Once I checked and understood we passed the restaurant I informed him about it and he straight blamed me for not stopping at the restaurant which passed almost 20-25 mins by then.  I asked him I will turn around and we will go the restaurant so that he can have the food he wants he just told me he doesn't want food anymore. He then just called my mom (who was in Dubai) and said I am not letting him eat and he is starving like anything and I am torturing him which baffled me and my mom started to ask me why am I fighting with my dad right when he landed . 

Somehow we reached home and he just complained to everyone he saw that I made him starve which obviously everyone believed because there no reason a 58 year old man(-child) has to lie about such things. 

Even recently when I was trying to say an opinion about education system my dad just straight up said da fuq you talking about education system you still hasn't passed your masters exams go pass that yourself. That was the day I was about to lose my self control because my dad had failed his 12th grade and only recently did some.night school and some other stuff to pass his 12th and get a degree and an MBA . I was the proudest person in the planet at the moment and was bragging about how inspirational my dad was for doing such a thing. But everytime he get a chance, nah fuck it, every second he has even a minute thing to make me feel.ashamed in front of a crowd he uses it. I can't fight back at him because I don't want others to laugh at my family thinking how dysfunctional are my family so I just  push all my anger and rage deep down and just stand there and take it. 

There's no one to help me in this world. I have tried to talk to my mom about it but all she has to say is to just adjust but I know deep inside me there's something bad that's growing which wound one burst and it won't be good. Even recently I have tendencies to put my father on a chokehold and take a knife and cut out his tongue so the he won't speak another word about me or just take my shirt and use it to choke him while he is driving (idgaf if I die if he dies in the process too) . I'm scared of these tendencies that come up in my mind because everyday I feel like it's getting closer and closer the day I might actually kill my dad. I hate this feeling 

I want him to understand what he is doing to me and stop him from doing more of such shit but whenever I try to talk to him he just say I'm a weak willed person who is a pussy who can't even handle a bit of pressure but I don't think anyone with their right mind will be able to handle my dad cuz of how much of an asshole he is to me . I have tried to tell him he is really really hurting me.

depression,Feeling like a failure ,"Hey, I am 22M and I suffer from really bad generalized anxiety disorder and I am on the autism spectrum as well. School was literal hell for me as I struggled to maintain friendships, dealt with not so nice people and academics in my early high school years were a complete struggle. The past eight years have been an absolute shitshow and no words can describe how angry I feel and how much of a failure I am. 

When I started grade nine (I am from Ontario, Canada btw), I had extremely high hopes for high school even though elementary school wasn't fun either. Just two months after I started my freshman year, a close friend of mine passed away unexpectedly which haunts me to this day because I still remember the very last words he said to me when school ended the day before he died ""See you tomorrow!"". After that happened, the rest of grade nine and grade ten were a struggle, my marks were slipping to the low 60's, I was continuously getting bullied for being on the autism spectrum and had to drop a few classes just so that I didn't get burnt out.

  
I ended up transferring high schools in grade eleven which helped a bit, but I was the new kid, so I really struggled making friends until I met a group of people who I honestly thought were my friends, but looked down on me because I had special needs and was placed in the applied classes rather than the academic classes. Grade 12 was my breakout year though and I worked my ass off, achieving a 93% average and won many awards after receiving my high school diploma. I was destined to go to college and do electrical engineering during the pandemic, so everything was online, ended up dropping out because I went to the hospital after a major episode of anxiety/panic attacks. So after that I worked a few really shitty jobs and tried going back to college again and I crashed and burned again. 

I am doing alright now, I work full-time at Walmart, I have my own car, I am debt free and have very supportive parents. However, my mind keeps telling me ""You need to move out"", ""You absolutely HAVE to go to college"", ""All of your peers are better than you"" and I cannot stop having these thoughts even though I lowkey absolutely hate school which is leaving me feeling like a complete failure.

-no friends
- ADHD

I truly don't know what to do anymore, I'm completely lost. 

I'm a 20 year old male with autism and possible OCD.

There are many things I want to talk about so this is going to be really long and unorganised.

From age 18 up until last year, I viewed and masturbated to CSAM, and the way I went about getting hold of it is equally bad, if not worse. I cannot express in words the shame and remorse I feel for this.

I know most of you hate me now and I don't blame you, and I guarantee you I hate myself more for it.

The most confusing part about it is I don't find children attractive, there's no groinal response, urges, desires, arousal, nothing. I don't even take a second glance or stare, the only thing I have is intrusive thoughts. Recently I was sat in the corner of a crowded bus, and since there was nowhere else to sit, three boys, none of which could have been older than 13 sat by me, one next to me, and the other two across from me, to which I felt nothing of that nature whatsoever.

My instincts when I've been around children in recent times is purely parental and protective.

I'd never hurt a child, especially in that way, I'd slit my wrists or set myself on fire before I did that, I might just slit my wrists anyway. 

I'd run into a burning building, I'd run out onto a busy road, I'd give my life to save a child's life. 

I don't go out of my way to be around children, I find them for the most part irritating, I don't hate them though. Throughout my entire life I preferred the company of adults. I even live across from a playground ffs.

I'm scarred for life by some of the things I saw in those images and videos, how the hell could someone do something like that?! I want to climb through the screen and protect those kids, give them a hug and let them know nothing can hurt them anymore.

I stumbled across an image hosting site when I was 16 whilst trying to find material involving my peers again, and the site hosted lots of cropped images of teens on webcams and older kids on webcams (it was obvious what they were doing), and on the page for the accounts, it usually displayed an email where stuff could be traded, but I didn't pursue that until 2 years later.

I went about acquiring it through sending old images and videos of myself, and in a lot worse way as well.

Starting from 14 up until last year, I very occasionally placed my phone in the bathroom and filmed my friends urinating, this happened definitely less than ten times, and most of them I deleted from everywhere, but I kept one and a screenshot of a few others, I started posting these images, as well as my own nudes, on an old reddit account which was deleted not long after, I made sure to hide their identities while doing this, I enjoyed the attention and compliments I would get, and I loved bigging up my friends and seeing them get compliments. 

Then I used this content to acquire the bad stuff years later, including the stuff of me.

I had an Idea that this was considered wrong but I didn't understand how it could have been harmful.

This happened to less than 5 friends, all the content I had I have long since deleted and wiped any access to, and I have no intention to do this again, but the main issue is the fact that copies could have been made of it, and I accidentally sent the uncropped video once.
There's the possibility none of this stuff is out there, but it's still vile and repulsive.

One of them was my closest friend, who I had known basically all my life, I broke down to him and told him what I had done and what I believe does me to this awful, reprehensible place, and you know what he did? He told me he forgave me and that some video possibly being out there doesn't phase him and his life isn't ruined at all and it will go on either way.

But he understandably said we can't see each other anymore, that he still loves me, believes I'm a good person and wants me to live a good life and make the world a better place, which was a dream of ours.

It's extra difficult because we were so close, we had experienced so much together, held all the same interests and beliefs, and I loved him only like family could, so the fact I committed this vile act of betrayal rids me with so much shame, and deservedly so. In a way I find it harder to get through because I didn't understand the true consequences of my actions and how this could have affected him and others, it would be less confusing and easier to accept I'm just the lowest form of humanity that way.

I displayed other problematic behaviours from a young age, all to do with boundary issues, I sometimes used to touch my friends when I was 12 but never their actual genitals, and I used to jokingly show my erection to people as well.

The only constant that I knew for certain is wrong is genuine rape and molestation, which is a line I know for certain I could never cross, and never will.

From a very young age (around 3 or 4) my mother would do very inappropriate party tricks around me with her friends late at night when they were drinking, her friends would call me sexy, and as I got older and hit puberty, she started making comments about my bulge and other things despite the fact I hated it and told her so.

When I was 7 I was groomed and molested by an 8 year old boy, I wanted him to help me pass a level on my DS game and he said he'll do it if I have sex with him, me being 7 I didn't understand what that was and with him being older I complied. We were naked during this, he fondled my genitals and got me to do the same to him, he inserted his fingers into my anus as well.

When I was 10, two of my close friends groomed me, they simulated blowjobs on each other and got me to do the same to them.

When I was 11, my 12 year old friend groomed and molested me despite me protesting, he got me to get in my bed with him and he rubbed up against me. Earlier that day he also got me to sit in his lap whilst cuddling me from behind, we were wearing underwear.

When I was 13, that same friend when he was nearly 14 and another friend who was already 14 groomed and molested me in my pool again, I had an erection in the pool and jokingly showed one of them it, and it escalated from there. They both got naked and got me to do so, I protested but eventually gave in to the pressure, they also showed each other their genitals and got me to do the same, later that boy got me to sit in his lap again whilst the older boy rubbed up against me. 

There was also just the normal experimenting stuff, one of my friends used to show me his erections and I would do the same.

All of my friends were going through puberty and their bodies were changing and so was mine, which I found incredibly fascinating and arousing, and I had seen most of my friends genitals and some other students genitals throughout growing up, so me being young and autistic, I became very curious.

Kids before finishing Elementary/Primary School were swearing and talking about sex, then as I got older (11) kids were drinking, smoking, doing drugs, talking about masturbation habits and apparently having genuine sex. Then by the time I was 13, there was a lot of students taking nudes, nudes being spread around school and nudes being leaked (including mine, which distressed me for a few days, but only because people knew they were mine, if they were spread around but they didn't know it was me, I wouldn't have cared), kids with condoms and other stuff etc.

I started watching non-pornographic sexual content online (sex scenes from movies, TV shows, games etc) at age 9 which I would genuinely get an erection from watching.

At age 10 I hit puberty (testicles largened) and I started masturbating to non pornographic stuff. Including videos of animals mating.
I also tried to find stuff involving my peers and found a fake video of stuff suggestive of that.

At 11 I started to grow pubic hair and had my first ejaculations, as well as discover porn, and I had my first crush which was on a 12 year old boy who was another friend, who I would masturbate to. This crush lasted a number of years, but he was straight so it couldn't go anywhere. This was also the age I started taking nudes and videos of me masturbating.

At 12 I started to grow underarm har and facial hair began to appear on my upper lip, I was watching porn very heavily at this point.

At 13 my voice had broken and I was nearly my full adult height, this was also the age I first masturbated to a non-sexual nude image of a child. As well as videos of stuff like naturism and videos of circumcision (I don't have a pain or gore fetish, I would just blank it out and focus on the genitals.)

By 14 I was my full adult height, I had adult sized ejacualtions and my penis had fully grown. And that is when I started posting my nudes online. To which I would have sexual conversations with adults, not knowing I was setting myself up to be groomed and have something normalised in my head which shouldn't be.

By 15 I was growing facial hair, as well as chest and abdominal hair. And I found a shotacon involving a boy my age having sex with an adult woman, and I would pretend to be him.

At 17, a 19 year old flirted with me and got me into sending nudes to him, and he did the same, which I didn't see as bad and despite it being technically illegal, I still don't.

I also did the same when I was 19 with a 17 year old stranger online, but they were very willing and I didn't pressure them, no personal info was shared between us. 

I also messaged a 15 and 14 year old at some point but stopped myself from letting it go any further. And cut them off before anything could be shared.

And when I started watching the CSAM, it was mostly teens 9n webcams that I watched, I was lured into thinking that this content isn't kids being assaulted or anything (which it is) and due to my experiences twisting my view, I thought kids were enjoying it (which they weren't) since I would have had enjoyed it at that age (which I wouldn't have) it wasn't until I saw unmistakable suffering which is when I stopped and vowed to never go there again. It was mostly stuff involving boys, the stuff involving girls I just found too revolting. I wanted to relive those experiences, go back to a time I was happier. It felt safe and comforting.

All of these experiencs warped my views and understanding of things, desensitised me and made me believe things were ok that weren't and that kids aren't as innocent as they are seen to be (which they are). I have never commited rape or an act of molestation and never will, these are acts I've always seen as vile and disgusting. 

I've suffered with mental health issues for a long time as well.

I've struggled with feelings of self-hatred and worthlessness since around 9 or 10. 

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 13, I've been self harming and suicidal since 15, I've also been attempting suicide since 15.

I've always felt like the odd one out, I always felt like I was the worst at everything, I was the one who was left out of games at school, the one who was always picked last in sports.

I was bullied a lot growing up, by students and occasionally teachers alike.

My mother is narcissistic and has been emotionally and occasionally physically abusive to me since I was 14 (telling me she hates me and that everyone else hates me, tells me how horrible I am, tells me that I should kill myself and do everyone a favour, threatened to stab me in my sleep, hit me on the occasion, bit me, threw things at me, including heavy things and glass, strangled me).

I truly don't know what to do anymore, I'm completely lost.

I'm sexually attracted to males 20 and over, and I'm romantically and sexually attracted to females 20 and over, I wouldn't even date an 18 or 19 year old.

The other two friends I stopped communicating with, I wiped the account  wiped the content from all areas they were stored on, deleted what they were stored, everything, and there is a possibility it's not out their at all.

I have never commited rape or an act of molestation and never will, these are acts I've always seen as vile and disgusting. 

I've suffered with mental health issues for a long time as well.

I've struggled with feelings of self-hatred and worthlessness since around 9 or 10. 

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 13, I've been self harming and suicidal since 15, I've also been attempting suicide since 15.

I've always felt like the odd one out, I always felt like I was the worst at everything, I was the one who was left out of games at school, the one who was always picked last in sports.

I was bullied a lot growing up, by students and occasionally teachers alike, and even my boss at my first job.

My mother is a heavy drinker, narcissistic and has been emotionally and occasionally physically abusive to me since I was 14 (telling me she hates me and that everyone else hates me, tells me how horrible I am, tells me that I should kill myself and do everyone a favour, threatened to stab me in my sleep, hit me on the occasion, bit me, threw things at me, including heavy things and glass, strangled me). There was also manipulation tactics like gaslighting, she alienated me from others by telling her friends and family how awful I was. Pushed me into meltdowns and got me to lash out, to which she called the police and got me arrested and made me look like the bad one on multiple occasions.

My father was a drug addict who died when I was 14, I saw him less than ten times my whole life, he grew drugs in my room when I was an infant, my most distinct memory is him coming to my house very late one night when I was around 9 or 10 talking about demons and bad spirits. 

Addiction runs in my family (my father's father is an equally heavy drinker, his mother is a drug addict who ran a brothel), so the addictive tendencies have been past down to me.

I probably was addicted to porn by 13, and had been feeding it for years without knowing it.

My adopted grandfather died when I was 4, and my adopted grandmother (which I lived with from birth) who was my guiding light, died less than a week before my dad did.

The only father figure I really had (who was an alcoholic but otherwise very good with me) was my mother's partner who she met when I was 6, and he died when I was 8. 

I was also very close to my mother's best friend, who had been more of a mother to me than my actual one had been some time died when I was 17. 

My mother had an abusive ex who stalked her and threatened to set fire to the house, who also left ranting letters and stood in the back garden at night, so we lived in fear of stuff like that for over a year from when I was 12 through 13. 

She also had an abusive lodger who was an even heavier drinker than she is, so from when I was 14 through 16 I witnessed them physically fight, both get arrested and on a few occasions I had to defend her from him.

Many of my friends have betrayed me over the years (I know I'm one to talk) but when this started to happen I would have never dreamed of betraying anyone, personal stuff was shared about me which I trusted them with, there was a lot of bad talking about me without me knowing. My toe closest friend turned on me at age 12 and isolated me from my other friends, I blamed myself at the time which I why I moved schools at 13 since I thought I was just making everyone miserable.

I didn't get diagnosed with autism until I was q9 despite trying to get it since I was 12, it hurt knowing I had been paying my whole life for being different, feeling ashamed of who I am (and rightly so now really), wondering why what I said was offensive, why I didn't understandfulky why this was wrong, why I was so sensitive to jokes, why I took e everyhing literally, why I made impulsive and reckless decisions  without understanding the consequences of them.

I was never considered attractive and was ridiculed for it (girls used to jokingly flirt with me to torment me at school). I'm 5'6, always have struggled with weight, hairline started receding at 16, eczema so my skin is always red, dry and flaky, really bad diastema and acid reflux which means it's really hard to make my breath smell nice and my teeth are very worn because of it. I have had sex with someone who was older than me and we were both consenting adults, and we were both very respectful of boundaries. 

I was also desensitised to other things slide gore and violence, I played a lot of violent video games when I was a kid, my mother is really into controversial shock movies (she got me to watch Cannibal Holocaust with her when I was 11).

The worst part about all of this is the fact all my friends who I love would hate me if they knew about what I've done so, none of them would trust me anymore or respect me, which is what friendships are all about right? So in a way they feel strange, they feel fake.

I could never find a relationship or true love because nobody wants to date a serial sex offender. 

I hate knowing the fact I'm a sex offender, it's eating me alive. 

I'm not registered and there is no real proof of what I did, so I can't turn myself in or anything.

I want to do good in the world, I have so much love to give, but it feels wrong me helping people because it feels like there is a sinister undertone to everything I do. 

I've always enjoyed being charitable, I love giving money to the homeless or putting change in a donations box.

I feel guilty whenever I feel hapoy since I don't deserve to be, the only things that I enjoy now are food and playing video games, it's the only job I get out of day to day life.

The only fate I deserve is being stabbed to death in prison or something. 

All I want is to be loved and accepted despite my flaws and mistakes, but I never could be.

The only other person I've told is my mother, who has been supportive.

I've been on antidepressants since 18 and I'm trying to get therapy, but I'm not hoping or expecting anything good will happen from this. I've been in and out of therapy since I was 11. 

I had dreams, I had aspirations, I wanted to change the world for the better, I wanted to have a son, not to hurt him, but so he doesn't end up like me, but I reliase that is not possible. I don't deserve to be around children.

I hate keeping secrets, but I have no choice but to keep this one. 

I want to identify with good people, but I can't.

Every good thing I do is invalidated now.

I forgive everyone who has wronged me in anyway, since I'm worse than them.

depression,I just want it to stop,"I just finished my AP exams today. I have to run a youth leadership camp for the weekend starting tomorrow. I know it'll be fun but I'm overloaded with work and expectations and I've been hurting myself more. Cut yesterday, rubbed an eraser hard into my hand today (enough to cause a small burn). I'm so damn tired. I can't see a therapist, even though I'm 18, becausr I was a dumbass and just gave my parents access to my medical records. I still live at home and they would definitely find out if I went, which would just create all sorts of unecessary drama and worry. It'll be 6 months before I can even think about seeing someone for this shit. 6 MONTHS!!! I feel like I'll either be dead or so far gone by then that it won't fucking matter. I'm starting to just give up on things. Grades, fun, family, any of that. And I graduate in two weeks! I should be excited but I'm just overwhelmed and I want it all to stop. I want to go to bed without thinking of killing myself and tearing up every night. I just want to go one day, ONE FUCKING DAY, without being sad or thinking of suicide or being stressed. I want to go without these high expectations and just enjoy life. One day without hurting myself and daydreaming about carving chunks of fat out of my hiedous, disgusting excuse of a body. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I'm losing who I am. I've become a hipocrite, a liar, a fucking thief, a manipulator. I've lost any faith I used to have and I don't know how to get it back. I just want to go to sleep and stay that way. Why can't I have just one good goddamn day? I've started contemplating taking some of my mom's gabapentin. I've heard it can destress and make you feel better. Maybe I'll just start sneaking that. And maybe I'll get lucky and accidently take too much one day...",0.155,0.196,0.649

i can’t speak about this with anyone because they’ll tell me “that’s life that’s what you’re supposed to do” but they never realize that when you’re mentally ill doing even the smallest things feels impossible. i’m so fucking tired. i have this deep void inside me every day and i find no joy in anything. 

i’ve been really overwhelmed lately because as i age, i realize that i’ve been struggling more than half of my life and im still continuing to struggle. i don’t have any hope that i’ll ever get better. as i grow older i end up finding more things to struggle about while still having everything else that i’ve been struggling with. 

this year has been really hard on me for that reason and just so many other factors in my life. i also feel so miserable about the fact that i feel so unloveable by everyone. everyone i’ve ever held close, from family to friends to partners, have done me so dirty and i seriously can’t trust anyone and don’t know when ill ever be able to. 

another thing that has me so miserable is working. i know that we’re meant to work but i hate that it’s like this because there’s no way that THIS is my life. i spend 48 hours every week at work and im exhausted. like i said, doing any task feels impossible with my mental health. i feel like every day is just on repeat. but obviously i need money so i can’t just quit but i wish i could get a fucking break. 

no one knows how much i truly struggle. no one gets it. i’m so tired of fighting and im so disappointed at the fact that this is what my life will be like. atp i feel like every bit of life i had left in me has been drained. i really dont want to do this anymore.

depression,Why can’t I get over my high school bully,"I was bullied for 2 and a half years. I don’t know what started it, her and I were friends freshman year. Then one day I did something and there would be texts and facebook messages telling me how she felt about me. She would say terrible things, but we were friends so I would not show our other friends to protect her. A friend of ours started dating a guy that was much older than us, she told me to message that friend and tell her she was a being a slut for whatever reason. I did and still haven’t forgiven myself for that, it was the only time I ever called another girl a name. After that is when I think the bullying got worse. She would tell me that I had said things about our other friends to her and she would push me to date this guy that liked me and I only seen him as a friend. I would show my dad these messages and cry almost every night. I went so far to get her to stop that I tried threatening her back to scare her into stopping. That just made it worse. She would tell me I need to stop playing the victim. When we were around our friends she would be super nice to them and nice to me, but she would not let me talk. I could never get a word out during conversations. It was like a game to her. It got to the point where I would sit alone in a secluded part of the school so I could feel safe.
On the night of our senior prom we were dancing to Soulja Boy and she had such good moves that I mentioned it to our friends. When I was back home she started texting me to shut up and not talk about her. I was thrown off. 
When college started it was like my friends were not my friends anymore, I didn’t know how to handle it. I wanted to tell them the truth about everything but I didn’t know how and when I tried she would say I need to stop making her sound like a bad person.
One day after college courses I went to the city bus stop and she was there. We got on the bus, she looked at me with hate. She sat at the back and I sat in the middle of the bus. During the ride she would yell things. When she got off I moved over so she couldn’t touch me. In the moment I thought it was funny that she was making a fool of herself in public. But really she didn’t care, she just wanted to hurt me more.
Before the bullying I used to wear pink everyday and be optimistic about everything, I was such a happy person. After the bullying I have a hard time making friends and I am quiet in groups of people. I don’t know who to trust. When I go somewhere I look at everybody because I am afraid she is there. I don’t know how to make good conversation anymore because I am afraid of upsetting others. My sense of humor has darkened and I find awkward moments funny.
Now that 10 years has passed since graduating I still don’t understand why they are not my friends. Over the past 10 years I blocked the other memories out, I guess I told myself they were too much to hold on to. I have always believed that I could be friends with my old friends again, given that the bully is not in the picture. But they won’t talk to me. I think she brainwashed them into thinking that I was bullying her.
I know I should get over it… I think what bothers me the most is what did I do wrong and how could they pick a bully to be their friend and not me.

Nothing really works, snri's worked for a while but it tore my soul out of my body and got me a lot of side effects so i had to switch to another one and another one ---- and another one. It took at least 2 years of my academic life and many months of my social and personal life, i really shut most people off. I got triggered again by moving out of my hometown so i could study at university but most probably my abusive environment at home and at school marked it's existence the most.

Also I was off my meds cause they weren’t helping so I thought I could go in, get more stable, medicated, then leave.

I explained that I was completely off meds and I became suicidal after becoming homeless again. (I was 18 at the time)anyways he basically says that I won’t be able to stay here long. (Which kinda felt like a jab since I wasn’t planning on staying there long I just needed to be stable) and he tells me he’s putting me back on the same meds I told him didn’t work for me. The social worker I met with reassured me that she would find me a place to live before I left when I first met her, so I started to feel a little less anxiety about leaving. Anyways about 2 weeks into being there, my social worker tells me she is struggling to find me somewhere to go, and try’s convincing me to go back to the shithole program I chose to be homeless again over being in. I obviously start panicking since I am scared of being on the street, and then the psychologist I met with starts pressuring me to choose between the program, a shelter, or my alcoholic father’s house. I tell him that if I leave within the next couple days I will still be a danger to myself and I could end up hurting myself. His exact words were “whatever you do outside of here is on you” I am so taken back by this response I break down and leave the room. I am like hyperventilating having a panic attack in my room because I was basically just told i am being fucked over, and nobody cares where I end up. I end up writing a grievance since he refused to changed my meds and what he said after telling him I was a danger to myself.

I find myself thinking of suicide regularly.  Daily.  Sometimes it’s my very first thought when my eyes open and the last one when I lay my head down at night. 

I have a plan. I’m a numbers person so the day and time are, dare I say, chosen and the date and time have meaning.  My mind won’t let me think about going past that as the date and time will never come again and then the meaning behind it is lost. And right now that’s not an option.  I know I will regret pushing past it.  For me the decision feels peaceful.  Like my mind is so tired that nothingness seems so welcoming.  ",0.068,0.246,0.686
depression,I’ve been left to go through a miscarriage on my own ,"I’ve been crying since I found out at the hospital about 12 hours ago.

depression,Could this be a depression?,"Hi! 19M here. I’ve never really considered myself “depressed” but the last few weeks have been something else, and I was wondering what the best way is to go about this.

I live in The Netherlands and we have final exams starting next week on Tuesday. Because it’s so important, we have had about 2 weeks off already in order to prepare.

Here’s the issue: I have done absolutely nothing yet. Every day so far has been pretty much the same: I wake up, open my books, read a few pages, and then I procrastinate the entire day in a really weird way. I know I have to study, I just can’t bring myself to do it. Anytime I get close I dive back into something else (mostly my phone) and rot a couple of hours away until the days come to an end and I even procrastinate sleeping.

Luckily I manage to do pretty well at school by myself, but for these exams my preparation right now is far from enough. 

Is this depression (related)? Has anyone been in a similar situation and/or have advice?

Anything is appreciated, thanks so much!

depression,i’m (F28) wondering if I have depression or if everyone feels this way? ,"to start off with, as an atheist, I find most of life pointless. to some, this is liberating, to me, it’s sad.

 I feel like most of existence is suffering one way or another. this makes it hard for me to pursue things I enjoy sometimes. for example, i enjoy drawing but then wonder what the point of it is? I understand it is to have fun and express myself, but is there even a point to that? I used to be able to enjoy TV and such but even that has become a little hard now. I can’t seem to concentrate.

admittedly, I have a decent life. I wouldn’t say it has been easy but I guess i’m conventionally attractive, have a nice job, can pay for bills. i’m in a relationship. I am a somewhat ambitious individual. but why can’t I seem to shake this feeling off?

 i’m coming to reddit at this point cause i’ve had some crying spells that have lasted for about a month or two now. I cry every evening at some point. I believe there is so much to cry about. is this just the human condition or do I def have depression? I have a history of a lot of mental health issues in my family but mostly due to circumstances (poverty). any advice is appreciated. thank you . ",0.155,0.117,0.729

depression,I don’t know what to do,"I’ve never posted on reddit before, so forgive me if I am going about this the wrong way.
I am 24F, I have what most would consider an incredibly privileged life. I am married to the love of my life, I am making an above-average income, I still live with my family for now.
And yet I can’t seem to feel joyful about any of these things. My whole life was centered around setting myself for success, and here I am, pretty much unphased by it all.
Long story short, I am incredibly depressed. The thought of waking up the next day is debilitating, I spend the night crying at the thought of having to live another day. Being conscious feels like a hassle, so I choose to sleep as much as I can. I have to use all the energy in my body to force myself to do basic things. I cannot focus on work, even though I have quite a flexible job it still feels difficult. When I had graduated from university I actually anticipated that my mental health would decline, the thought of my life consisting of the same, depressing routine? It felt inevitable but I never thought it would be this rough.
And I feel really guilty about it. Why, was I, someone who can’t even see the joy in anything blessed with so much privilege? I would rather have someone who can actually appreciate and find value in life have what I have. A family, a job, and love. And yet I still can’t shake this feeling of dissatisfaction.
My biggest issue is that I just cannot see the value in living, what is the point? There is no meaning in life, people tend to tell me to look forward to my future, but what is there to look forward to if you are someone that finds no value in life at all? 
I am currently seeing a therapist and have been seeing a therapist for three years, I just recently started getting medicated in October 2023 because I felt that I was going to hurt myself.
Medication helped me feel somewhat normal for a little while, but the last two months I have quickly fell back into a major depressive episode. 
I can’t find the will to consistently keep up with my responsibilities. I keep postponing or cancelling. I don’t want to do anything anymore, I just want to sit in bed and wait for it all to end.
I am so sick of seeking help, it feels hopeless.
My family doesn’t know what’s going on and I feel guilty about how often I bring this up to my husband. I just really needed to get this off my chest, I feel that nobody truly understands.

Well continuing through March I kept taking the Vraylar. My psych overlooked that he didn't place me on anything for a month, and I did not realize that Vraylar was an add-on treatment. It wasn't until April that I started Fetzima. So I spent March unmedicated for MDD.

The worst part is I feel like I don’t deserve to feel like this because I haven’t been through much physical abuse really (a little bit by my dad but he’s stopped a while ago) I also feel like somehow my brain is gaslighting me into feeling like this and I don’t actually because I don’t deserve to.
I just feel like nothing. I cry all the time and I’m anxious about everything.

depression,Self improvement made me even more depressed ,"I lost weight. Went to therapy every week. Changed my style. Took care of myself even if it meant skipping sleep. I workout 4-5x a week. Eat clean. Journal everyday. I don’t drink and I try my hardest not to hurt myself. I thought life would’ve been different if I had just gave myself another chance. 

I go to a PWI (white and Asian). The first semester I was doing great. New environment, different people and perspectives. Life should be great but I got bullied and faced constant racism. I reported to the OEA and despite issuing a restraining order to the Asian girl who harassed me, they gave her a slap on the wrist. She was my roommate alongside some other Asian girl so it wasn’t a one time thing. I got constantly harassed and at one point I started sleeping in the study room or in the library to avoid them especially her. OEA told me we both made mistakes. No I didn’t, I didn’t even do anything to that girl. I made the mistake simply because I’m black and dark skinned.

This semester is almost over and though I’m completing it with straight A’s I still feel inadequate and empty. I constantly think about kxlling myself. I know the exact place that I’ll do it. 

The only thing that has changed is that I look different outwardly. I was always slim but now I’m even thinner.  I still don’t have friends and can’t seem to find a bf. I find that guys will still go after an out of shape non black girl over a fit black girl. I used to cope by telling myself that maybe it’s normal for girls not to get approached in public but that’s not the case. I’ve seen very basic women getting approached. Overweight. Bad skin. Poorly dressed. They’re white/asian/ light skinned though so that’s a boost. On apps, I get matched with very hot guys so maybe I’m just uglier in real life. I don’t do apps anymore since everyone on there seems to just be horny and want to hookup. 

You’ll automatically get disqualified in life for everything simply for having dark skin. I can’t convince myself that I’m ugly, I’ve tried to do it many times but I have had to be honest with myself. I’ve never been told that I’m ugly and the very few compliments I get from women they say beautiful instead of pretty. It’s only from women, men simply just stare at me. Never approached and I know why; it’s because I am black. I don’t like the staring so I’ve started to isolate. 

I’ve began to accept that I’ll be alone forever and joined some new subs related to that for support. Thing is I can’t relate to some stuff in them, one is being told I’m ugly etc. 

Going to classes and being on my campus is mentally draining. Being a black girl just makes everything so hard. Everyone views you as lesser than. I’m a premed student but I have no hope for medical school. The demography of people at my current Uni will be the same at medical school wherever I go. Whether I choose to attend med school at my current uni or elsewhere. I feel so hopeless and the only way out is not being here anymore. Being book smart, thin and okay looking doesn’t help when you’re black and especially dark skin. At least I tried again.

I have so many phobias that I go insane, and it impacts my ability to live. My life isn't too bad either compared to other people's lives. However, I am still very unhappy. It just feels like the bad outweighs the good. You have to go through the boredom of work/school everyday, deal with intrusive thoughts about stuff that happened in the past, not have any relationships because you have fucking social anxiety to the point where you cannot even initiate conversations (Although SSRI's helped me with this tremendously for a bit), only to get basically no reward for your free time.

 These issues will never go away, I just have to learn how to cope with it. I always believed this, but my therapist reaffirmed this belief to me. Her advice is that this is just the way life is and everyone has anxiety and feels down. There are ways to cope, but she also told me that practicing techniques learned in therapy will probably only reduce the symptoms by about 30%. This is something I've been told not only by my therapist, but by others around me including parents and friends that have moved to different places. It's believe this is true, but here's the thing: Why would I want to cope and not just kill myself? Even if I reduced my symptoms by ""30%"", the bad in life would still outweigh the good. Life feels like a very crappy video game that I'm not supposed to quit. I like my therapist, but therapy teaches me how life is supposed to feel, and quite frankly, I just cannot fathom how suicide is not the answer. Even during the time SSRI's briefly improved my mood drastically, I wasn't functioning so well. It was manageable, but if therapy can't get me to anywhere near that point, then I just don't see the point. I'm not suicidal because I really don't want to ruin my parent's lives, but I still don't understand how it's not the solution to this mess.",0.169,0.072,0.76

depression,I want to drop out of university.,"I have always knew that studying isn't for me, I dropped out of highschool after not passing last year and got my GED in a month, i didnt continue in high school because i didnt study at all and didnt have any motivation, not because i was lazy but because i lost all the passion and motivation i had previouslyfor school, i used to always get good grades.

Eventually right after i git my GED, I was forced by my parents to apply to whatever university that would accept me, eventually I started at a German university online, (for context: I live in Italy).

Now I am in the 1st semester, and honestly I feel worse than ever, I don't want to waste my parents time and money by making them believe I am a good student who would like to continue these 3 years and take a degree.

I already told my mom about my feelings, she brushed them aside and kept insisting that I will be a loser and a failure in life if I don't obtain a degree, she also said I won't find a suitable partner who would love me because I don't have a uni degree ( for context: she is egyptian, so diplomas and degrees are basically the basics of life for us, and it is also more for her, because she was a genius student who graduated with honors, same for my stepfather).

I know I am supposed to have some major plan so I can replace uni with it, but I can't think of anything, so I came here for advice 🙃.

Really sorry for the long rant, but I would like to ask u guys for cold hard truth advice on what I could do in my situation.

depression,Depressed individuals: Have you fallen in love with your spouse?,"My fiancée and I are progressing towards love, understanding, respect and sacrifice since we started our relationship a month ago only.

• My situation: I feel extremely anxious and stressed. I think of her a lot. I need to exert effort to shift my mind to something else. I miss her always. I overthink what I can do for her to make her satisfied and happy. I wish to know each and every aspect of her life. I feel obsessed with her. 

Her situation: She misses me and thinks of me and experiences drop in focus (but not as much as I do). I suspect she’s experiencing what a normal person would after starting such a serious relationship.


Overall she’s okay, but I’m not.

depression,I don't want to live. Today my second grandpa passed away two months after my first grandpa - I don't know how to feel? It still isn't really getting to me. ,"

My first grandfather passed away in mid-February, he was 85 years old. At the news of his death, I was in despair, heartbroken, I couldn't pull myself together for many days. We had a great bond and I loved him very much.

Today I was informed that my other grandfather died (he was 93). Upon hearing the news, I just locked myself in my room and have no desire to talk to anyone or eat or do anything. However, I can't fall into despair like I did upon hearing about my first grandfather, I'm just not able to. I feel like my head is light, I feel bad, but I am also unable to believe it. It doesn't get to me yet.

It's all happening so fast, I haven't yet had time to go through the grief of my first grandfather thoroughly and I've already lost my second, my only one.... I don't know how to feel, I can't even express my emotions, all I feel is emptiness and I consider this year tragic.... I lost two grandparents in such a short interval and I don't know if I can cope with it. I know - some may write that it's a beautiful age and they would like to live to such an age (me too) but the two huge losses I am experiencing this year may finish me completely...

depression,i told myself i’ll be dead by 18 and it’s almost my 18th birthday,"i’m F17 and i’m turning 18 in july. i haven’t been happy in so long and i’ve told myself everyday since i was 12 years old that i will kms before i’m 18. i can’t believe i’ve made it this far and my therapist says she is happy for me but i can’t help but be disappointed that with all the attempts i’ve made at ending my life, none of them have worked. it makes me feel like a failure.

i’ve planned out my suicide countless times. when one way doesn’t work, i try again another way. the only problem is i don’t have much access to the “real stuff” anymore because my family knows so they’ve restricted and taken away everything. i have a curfew and don’t get cash, not allowed to work and im monitored. they care and i’m grateful but this disorder, along with bipolar and bpd makes my life a living hell so it’s hard to see the point in all their efforts. 

I’ve had so many attempts that i stopped counting but i can confidently say the number surpasses 10. i can’t remember the reasons for each of them and that makes me sad because i know how precious life is, i just wish i could give mine to someone else, without all the mental issues, and they can live it to the fullest. i know how privileged i am, but i can’t imagine living anymore with my mind. i’m a waste of a human life.

my symptoms only get worse with time, even with psychiatric meds and treatment. it’s scary to grieve the fact that i don’t have a normal life and at the same time, grieve that i’ll probably be the one to end it but don’t know exactly when. 

if someone doesn’t beat me to it, i think i will take matters into my own hands. i’m scared everyday i’m alive that it will all get too much again and that’ll be my last day. but it’s also comforting that i get to choose where, when, and how. 

with all this being said, i’ve decided that i’m going to be turning 18 this year and that’s the hardest decision i’ve ever made in my life.

depression,25 no life in the UK,"hello first time i'm telling this to anyone but i feel like i have no life. I have one real friend irl who lives far away from me but that's it, we play games together a few times but not a constant time or day, just whenever one of us asks the other. I have a really good internet friend who i play a few games with which is something i guess and i'm in chats for my hobby but i want a group of IRL friends where i can ask ""hey do you want to meet up and do X thing X day"" 

As far as my family i only have my grandparents who are also really far away so i don't have a strong family foundation which i think has effected me mentally. I grew up in the care system and for the most part it was ok but my early years were bad, especially when i was just becoming a teenager i lived with some foster parents between the ages of 10 to 13 who grounded me to my room for at least 1 year but i don't fully remember. The only time i was allowed out of my room was for school and to eat food so it was basically like prison. Before that i lived in a children's home from 6 to 10 and i don't know exactly how to explain it but i was bought up soft? so i was well behaved and wasn't rebellious so when i was grounded by my foster parents i didn't know how to stand up for myself. Then after that i was in another children's home from 13 to 18 but this one was so much better and i'd say its still the best place i lived. But i made a mistake, for some reason it took them ages to find a school and when they did finally find one i accepted BUT i wanted to say no for one reason, it was an all boys school and originally i said no but then the staff member i was with literally made me feel embarrassed by asking ""are you only saying no because you want a girlfriend?"" At this time i was 14 i think? But like i said before i was bought up soft so out of embarrassment i just accepted. I think this messed me up in not knowing how to talk to girls so i just never tried. Sorry for the life story but its context 

Never had a girlfriend or been on a date, in fact ive never even spoken to a girl in the way to pursue a relationship ever because as eexplained growing up i was was never around girls throughout my teenage years

No job so one to talk to irl and basically no work experience and i failed school so i can't get a career. 

I never drank alcohol because i'm scared of getting addicted (i know sounds weak) so no social connection there either 

I have 0 motivation and am extremely lazy, i don't cook real food just oven stuff or noodles/soup on the hob, my flat is a mess i have no motivation to clean it and i have poor hygiene only showering a few times a week at most. 

For the most part of my life i haven't actually felt depressed or maybe i have but just told myself i'm not? Because ive always been neutral or happy in terms of how i feel but literally within the last few days i think its started, i guess its started to reflect that i'm a loser nobody that has no life, no friends, girlfriend, job or family

As far as suicidal thoughts i haven't had any and i don't think i will but i have thought ""well if i died who would really care""

I worry I won't be able to create a welcoming space for them to come visit. I can't cook for more than one person. I basically do not have strong enough life skills or social skills to really be part of their lives. My life is standing on a bunch of wobbly toothpicks. I’m barely able to look after myself. Plus the autism. So socializing is a big concern for me. It’s hard to socialize when you can barely think straight from stress or lack of sleep. And sometimes words fall out of my mouth that embarrass me and I present completely different from how I want to and am so mortified after - basically I come off as a bit of a spazz, I say things wrong without meaning to, like Tobias from Arrested Development. It's all part of the autism. I'm not good at telling jokes and sometimes don't clue in on jokes. Worst of all is I have no idea how to be like an adult in my mannerisms and not like a child in an adult body. This is what really bothers me and makes me afraid to be an aunt/onkle. Cause it's like a stereotype for aunts and uncles to be awkward and like ""I'm hip"" or ""how do you do fellow kids?"" That is me and I genuinely don't know how not to be like that. 😓

I have really good aunts, uncles and older cousins - they have good social skills, they're nice people, they're able to hold a job and relationship and exist normally. There is no way I can live up to their standards. I have a very different life from them, I border on being like a hobo compared to them. :( This is why I don't want to get too close to new family members.

depression,"Mid-40s(M), constantly depressed, worried, negative and need help to fix my mind and my life","TLDR: I'm constantly depressed and negative and tired of feeling this way, I need help

The full monty: I’m in my mid-40s now, person of decent health, aside from a permanent spine injury that will surely affect me in my later life (lower back), and an injured knee - I’m in good health. I still have mobility as an average normal person.

I was in the service industry, in management (keeping it general due to anonymity), but did ok till I was let go pre-pandemic. Struggled to find a job post that, till I was lucky to get another similar job in the same service industry but had to resign due to how toxic the environment was (many others resigned after that). Part of the reason I left was also a deep desire to switch to another industry that is not service. I left that job late last year, and had no luck finding a job that’s compatible to my seniority (mid-senior level). Still looking for a job now, while freelancing to make some cash before my savings burn out in a few months. Can't go back to my old industry as it is highly-political. I'm good as my job, and I know what I can bring. 

My depression and worry stem from worrying about the future. I’m aware that worrying about the future is useless but that doesn’t stop the endless salvo of depressing feeling. I worry about building a nest egg for my wife and having a decent retirement setup. My country has no social retirement plans so it's down to savings. I refuse to burden the missus and don't want to disappoint her, who was supportive of my earlier decision and very supportive of me – but I can’t and don’t want to let her down. She is my rock and I want to be hers. However it isn’t easy, I always see the down-side of things, hard to think of positive things In my sleep I would usually wish that I don’t wake-up as it is easier to things to go this way but I don’t want to. What’s more depressing is every time I go on LinkedIn to network, to find leads for jobs, I don't mind much, and reading all the positive news of my connections is just depressing. Everyone else is getting jobs and promotions and growing in their career but me.

I’m tired of being negative, depressed and constantly worried. I was in therapy for 6 months, understand it wasn't long but it didn’t help at all. I’ve stopped it to ease up on financial commitments. I’m a good person, always open to help others, but can’t see positivity for myself.

I have relatively good routine in the day, up, exercise for 20 – 30 minutes, and continue hustling, working but it's not helping. I’m tired of wishing for an end and I just want to change. Living can't be this mentally challenging. How do I fix me?

depression,"So far, things are the same or slightly worse","Well, first, hello y'all. Second, I did some posts on this subreddit about my 2023. Well, i was excited initially since it seemed at first as though my episodes were fading away...but nope. As I returned to school year, I realized life had planned another things, aparently.

So, I was told some dark backstories of beloved people (neglect and disrespect), and i fell again on my adicctions on cutting and ""druging"" my mind.

Also, a new inner hardship appeared: No love partner and inferiority.

I've seen myself get rusty or beaten by most people in almost anything i try; sports, arts, study areas, or even in love.

So now, I feel so helpless, lonely and weaker. And it's even worse 'cuz I was one of the bests on music, sports or classes. I feel like I have even less to support myself with, than before.

Like, what the hell man?! Can't be life a little nicer? Or better said, can't my mind be nicer?

My suicidal ideations and hopelessness have returned, and are even stronger now.

I feel like everyone is better than me. I try it all, yet people just demonstrate how lazy, foolish and incompetent I am.

This is a mess of a life. I've experience betrayal, dissapointment, loneliness, and helplessness. I want this to stop already. This is shitty, and I don't like myself at all. I feel like a stupid freakin' femboy who pretends they can joke their way into hapiness.

I have these horrible memories that chase me. At random times, those memories catch me and I just freeze in place, and I struggle to keep myself up and focused. Every day has something missing. Something so miniscule, yet so essential, and it's demotivating to not know what is making me sad sometimes. Some days I know the reasons, but other I kinda just am like this.

Hello everyone. 

I'm 28m and got laid off a few weeks ago from my bartending job. And I'm in a state where our unemployed program is so screwed up I'm having issues even getting that so even know I have savings I feel like I'm drowning.  

I feel like I don't know what to do with my life. I've had a few jobs that include 

Sales for verizon Fios
Sales/ brand ambassador for fitbit/ Samsung 
Business to business Sales for Comcast 
Bar manager / bartender for a brewery 

I haven't really enjoyed any job besides my brewery job. And I've been told I really well at it. But it didn't pay much. I have also contacted other brewies near me with very little luck and it seems like alot of the breweries are not doing to well. I also got to make about 6+ beers for them which got great reviews on untapped but again I was passed up to be a assistant brewer at at 2 breweries.

My Sales jobs I haven't really liked especially comcast the leads were so so poor. I did well for verizon even tho that was harder Sales wise as well as I was selling FIOS in a wireless store ( I also applied back for this same job after getting laid off and was turned down which makes no sense to me as I had experience doing that same job at a relatively high degree for 2 years.)

I don't even care about making a ton of money I just don't wanna hate my life every day and I'd rather have more time to do stuff with family and friends then working 40 hours a week. 

I really wish i could have my own business as I don't like the idea of working hard to make others rich. 

Things I enjoy are. Cooking, gardening, craft beer, stocks,  investing , sports, art. Design , tattoos

depression,"i hate doing stuff i dislike, and it scares me","i hate doing anything that i don't like or won't serve me a purpose.

i've been asocial for most of my life because i just dislike social interaction, despite feeling alone if i dont talk to anyone. when i feel alone and do exceptionally talk to someone, i just get this immediate instinct of just avoiding it like the plague, and so i do, and shortly after begin to feel alone.

i don't go out because i don't like going out, and so, i now have a streak of many months without getting out of my home.

i've also never been able to study 10 minutes straight for an important exam if it's something i'm not interested on. take for example the history of king phillip the fourth, or the fact that Wilhelm Wundt opened his first experimental laboratory in psychology at the University of Leipzig, Germany, in 1879. i just cannot endure the meaninglessness of it like everyone else at my class can, and i'm currently failing 3 subjects.

i know for a fact that, after i finish college (if i do finish it), that i'll be either spending the rest of my life working a job that i'm not really all that interested for a good pay in exchange, or for a bad one if i dont finish college, and that i'll be forced to spend 8 hours plus commute transport every single day of my life until i die.

i do have hobbies and enjoy many different stuff, which i sincerely love dearly, but life being what it is, just doesn't cut it for me.

i don't have anyone whom i enjoy their presence around me, nor i have anything else that motivates me to keep going. im tired of just getting dragged by the flow of my mundane life day after day, and i see nothing worth living for.

i'm seriously considering suicide, and i don't feel sad or bad about the fact that i might kill myself; it doesnt make a difference for me to be alive or to be dead. im just tired of living, and year after year has proven me that nothing will ever change to better, and if it would change, it has always been to worse.",0.083,0.176,0.741

I think being busy also works, like if I make a dinner date with a friend or just keep active.  It's the spaces in between that seem to get me fowled up, if I get stuck in negative thinking.

depression,How to Stop The Need to Be Heard - Depression and Anxiety,"TLDR: As I get older, I find that literally NO ONE (minus my spouse) pays any attention to me or what's important to me, often ignoring me completely, leaving me to feel like I'm invisible, or that my life will never have value. I've shared my whole life with the world, and literally almost no one cares at all. It hurts alot.

Perhaps I'm just some kind of narcissist or other type of mentally-ill where I think about things on a really-deep and philosophical level and want to talk about those things with the world. I'm an extrovert, so I really get re-charged by interacting with the other people in the forums of social media, arts, etc. I'm not trying to tout any intelligence or superiority, as I think I'm more damaged and spiteful than I am useful or valuable. I'm also a depression-sufferor for over 20 years and am currently medicated to a satisfactory degree. In recent years I've become extremely-unhappy with my purpose in life as I've grown and matured. I'm entering my late 30s, a time which most people would consider ""settled down"". I'm VERY happy with my spouse and child; people to whom I owe almost all my thanks and love. I work in a profession that people think is high-paying, but it's not nearly as much as one might think. I don't have vast resources, but I'm able to live without credit cards, something that I thank \*some\* higher power for - whenever I can.

My entire life, I've been an artist, a writer, public speaker, actor, musician, and debat-er. (NOT PROMOTING ANYTHING) I also think that I've spent most of my entire life questioning things, being critical of the world, mostly doing everything in my power to make things better, more just, more happy for the most people - It's ultimately led me to living in a very progressive mindset, something I don't mind sharing with others, who I know don't always want to hear my liberal talking points. I know that most people want to be left alone, so I'm learning to often keep my opinions to myself. However, I'm finding that the older I get, the less anything that I do, matters to anyone except one or two people, the ones who live in my own home with me.

I wrote heartfelt music for 15 years, pouring my bleeding heart into everything I made. I wrote a book in 2017 full of important lessons and existential struggles and hardship, exploring the dynamics of faith and church abuse for the critical thinkers. I work in a job where I sincerely help people in one of the most powerful ways. However, I don't really get any thanks for what I do; rather, I get complaints and criticism by people who could have never helped themselves, often out of messes they've made. I spent 15 years and thousands of dollars trying to make music and art that literally no one ever listened to online, in person, etc. My own wife hasn't even read my book, which hurts on a whole other level, but that's not really the discussion I'm having here.

I feel like I've self-excised my whole being out there for the world to accept, but I'm just nothing. Sometimes, I feel like if I were more important, people might care about my opinions, feelings, etc. Maybe if people admired me, they'd want to talk to me and engage in debate or conversation about the world and other things. I know I could probably be a better listener, but I'm conflicted, as I believe that I'm being fake if I only give attention to others, or listen to them so that they will return the gesture. I'd rather be a real nobody than a fake somebody, I guess. It's just really really hard to feel so un-cared-for, so meaningless to anyone in the outside world. As an extrovert, I have a GIANT hole in my mental state that makes me feel this profoundly.

I could go on and on and on. I honestly am feeling it right now, feeling like no one would read this or care. I'm just one face in a sea of faces that has an un-solvable problem - who isn't worth time to care about. There's just so much in me that I want to share; but it hurts when no one engages or cares.",0.162,0.109,0.729

depression,(19m)I don't know what to do.,"I feel empty all the time I feel like I want to have fun. I want to feel happy but no matter what I do I just can't. So I just play video games most of the day to try to feel better. 

The only thing that has helped me at all feel normal is being with a girl I love but considering the last one I dated broke up with me a week after 2 of my grandparents died who I loved very much I'm just feeling hurt.


And because of that I played for honor on Xbox for 7-10 hours a day for 7 months straight because it's the only thing that helped me not think about everything.


I've talked with over 20 girls I met on sites and I met up with one had an amazing date everything went well she enjoyed all of it then by the time of the second date she does not want to be in a relationship.

And the with rest I talk to it goes well then I get ghosted after 1 phone call.


I just want to feel normal. I want someone to make happy and to make me happy. I just want to not spend the entirety of all my days trying not to feel lonely and trying to make myself happy and failing.

Any advice?

At her house I suffer psychological and physical abuse daily and my body hurts from having to serve her and clean everything she dirtyes every day (mainly the bathroom, she fills it with shit all the time).

And I'm not saying this from victimhood, believe me, it's a reality.

I'm 25 (female) and suffer from depression since my childhood. I was sexually , physically abused for 3 years. I had a very difficult childhood. My father suffers also from depression. My mother has ocd and a narcissistic personality. My sibling has anger issues also narcissistic. Because of them I was in fostercare and lived on my own in my teen years. When I went to college we had contact again and become over couple years a family again. Right now I have a good relationship with them but still distant because of their mental issues. Im in therapy since 2 month. My therapist told me it is normal that I'm not feeling good right now because of my traumas. I could never grieve or let my emotions out after everything happened and that's the reason I'm letting every emotions out right now and it would take time. But I feel like my depression will never end and sometimes I feel so hopeless. I'm always tired. I'm forcing my self to speak with people. Im putting on a fake smile everyone things I'm happy and fine but I'm suffering inside. I feel numb have insomnia, everything is gray and just sadness. I'm exhausted always and just feel dead and numb inside. Do you now the feeling when you stay up all night and your body and brain don't funtion or the day after a hangover. I'm feeling almost every day like this. My family is not supportive they are just there for good days sadly. They never allowe me to feel sad exhausted speak about my feelings trauma or to cry. I'm only allowed to be happy and strong infront of them, so they are not an helping environment for me. Do you have tips for depression or do you have experience with therapy for depression.

At the news of his death, I was in despair, heartbroken, I couldn't pull myself together for many days. We had a great bond and I loved him very much.

depression,I feel like I understand how hard life is now and don't think it's worth the effort,"I have been having negative thoughts about humanity and life most of my life, first being suicidal at 11 due to my loneliness of switching schools and I guess anxiety and being a bit clueless socially or not being able to act like others. I ended up not caring about putting in effort in socializing, even though I have never been too interested in small talk and most topics people around me talked about. Only after leaving high school I realized that I should have tried way harder to have friends, I hate how lonely my life is and it has been close to 10 years since then. I did get better at socializing, but I have a feeling it's mostly because of how ""normal"" I look, or because of being somewhat nice to look at (it was easier for me to connect with guys, because of interest from their part and interests in common). I took longer than I hoped 
I did get an autism diagnosis last year, level 1 and they said ""barely"" but it still explains a lot, and thought it was a relief but it also made my self-esteem worse and I feel nearly hopeless about getting better at connecting with people and especially having friends a lot. The few friendships I have managed to get aren't good for me, or simply aren't deep. I don't know how to get closer with people and have a fear of making them uncomfortable by being weird because of not knowing how normal friendships work among other things

I tried to get friends by bumble bff and just taling with more girls, which didn't work to get connections I feel real as I don't think I have much in common with women in general, sure some like me a bit but outside of work I don't have a chance, I even joined a group for girls who want to make friends and didn't get any close friend. One told me I'm too mysterious and should just share more about me and whats going on in my life, but definitely the autism and anxiety affects it too. 

This past year or months, when I stopped dating or felt the loneliness despite that, I kept thinking about how my life really is and how different it is from how people live, and realized things too. Like how people have seen me and still do, and recently I saw a tweet about how hard it is to get back into socializing after being comfortable with isolation for so long, people were saying you never come back, some that only by really putting in the effort. But I have been like this most of my life, based on that I don't think I can change much.
Also, how I mostly never cared or put too much effort or interest into things. It really makes me think I have been depressed most of my life.

I have been seeing a guy since February. This guy was friends with my sibling and he kept telling her he wanted to date me since 2022. I told her I wasn't interested in going out with him at first because I wasn't emotionally available, I just didn't feel like dating or anything. But his friendship with my sibling remained and we just kept interacting on social media and stuff, both giving likes and sometimes he flirted, and overall he always seemed like the kind people say he is good person and definitely the feminist and respectful kind.
We first met in person in September or so, and then kept talking and kept seeing each other first mostly in a sexual way (though there was affinity), but we kept talking a lot everyday or almost and also hanging out without anything sexual. He was very affectionate for most of it, though sometimes inconsistent and also didn't want to see me as much or didn't seem as interested as I am used to when seeing someone, so I did have waves of sadness already when he wasn't talking to me as much as before. Despite that I really tried with him and tried to be as expressful and affectionate as I could, seeing if he did the same and he did except for times when he just told me he wasn't feeling well and such. He cancelled a few plans the same day, saying his father had a heart problem or he had a cold or something, which only made me worry a bit for him too. I do rhink that the past weeks, when he started therapy again, he did feel guilty and that's why he became a bit less affectionate, but still he never got the chance to be honest and let me know the truth: he has had a girlfriend since late 2022, dating since months earlier. She found out this weekend as he couldn't hide things well, and told him to tell me, and he told me in a very distant way and without detail, also lying about them being on bad terms since December and with vague answers and no detail. Only because I tried to get in touch with the girlfriend to make sure she knew, because of how vauge he was, she  talked to me and told me the truth. 
I feel like how long it took to get the truth, with him also forgetting to mention that he had a girlfriend this whole time in a second message hours later, and everything just made me suffer more by not being able to deal with it all at once and having to put in the effort to know what happened.

I know that because of my loneliness and few interactions normally, and as much experience socializing as a teenager maybe, I am more sensitive to these social and emotional ways, I know that logically but I still can't help that these days I haven't been able to eat much or even sleep. I have never felt this sad and hopeless. I thought I would sleep better today but I just wake up so many times and it's on my mind how he might just be still only suffering about fear from me telling others. Which I am by the way, I know it might not be right and seems crazy on my side but today I woke up so stressed and anxious about this and if his friends knew and if he is doing it to more people, that I messaged a couple of his closest friends (both women) to let them know. One already told me that she will maintain contact but talk to him about it, but I know she felt it was weird and wasn't sure what I was gaining from this. We both were respectful though, but she told me things like this have happened to her and to try to let it go and move on, and talking with girlfriends and crying and things, but I really liked him a lot since I first made the effort to date him because I never liked anyone and I'm so lonely too so I'm feeling way more sad, and hopeless too with everything else in my life regarding intimate relationships, than she thinks. And well I don't have girlfriends and I'm not even sure I want to insult him yet. Of course, I didn't tell her that or that I'm autistic and that's why she found what I'm doing so weird.
I honestly just want to sleep better and told her because that was on my mind these past days, I did it as soon as I woke up because I am waking up with so much stress and anxiety I don't know what to do. But I think she will keep it to herself only and not tell her friend group and I guess I will have to deal with that being that way and stop getting invested in this.


I do everything recommended to sleep better and though I'm not sure I feel sad over him that much, I still feel very anxious and stressed, and I don't know disappointed? I do feel some relief maybe I guess, that I'm not in that inconsistent loop anymore wondering what he thought, but also relief of having an experience that unfortunately is common with women and comes with socializing. But, even though I guess this is what life is about and people coming and going and humans feeling emotions, I think I don't like any of that. I think I don't like socializing if it means this and so complex things, and at the same time I still feel so alone and sad about it that I know I should do it. But it seems like suffering in both ways.


I just feel like I have a lot to work on myself and there's also life to work on, things like all the things people need to do and care about every day, and things like what happened to me recently and more bad things to keep happening and it seems too much for me to cope with. And I can't put effort into it if I'm not even sure I will enjoy life and be happy at any point. My wish for my birthday for years has been to be happy and it only happens very momentarily, like a distraction of how I really am. I have been going to therapy since March, I know I should have started sooner but it is a hard system to get into I think, at least with health insurance covering, and more if you try to get people that understand about autism in women. I did try psychoanalysis in 2020 after I had to go to the hospital because I wanted to kill myself and wouldn't stop crying, but it made it worse, and the one I tried after/during my autism diagnosis basically didn't want to have me as a patient as she didn't know how to deal with autistic adults. I'm doing fine with this current one though I know I have too many sessions and things to go through to be better and I feel like I might need a psychiatrist too.

depression,"desperate to get out of ""freeze response""","i'm a US medical student and i've been stuck in a phase of not wanting to do anything and wanting to sleep all day for months. i really want to stop this and become functional again but I don't know how to accelerate it. it's frustrating because the progress is so slow despite doing all the ""right things"" - on meds, going to therapy, got an emotional support animal, reached out to friends and family for help, etc. 

education has obviously been affected and my friends basically forced me to go to class, labs, etc so I didn't flunk out, which I really really appreciated. but at some point, I have to be able to do this myself. my therapist says I've made much improvement since I've hit rock bottom a few months ago and that I just need to be patient, which I know this is all true. the problem is that medical school moves at a whole different pace than my progress. I'm currently studying for a board exam but have barely been able to actually do it. the expectation is to study 8-10 hrs/day. I've been doing maybe 2-3 hr (if that) and I have trouble staying focused even during those few hours. at this rate, I won't be able to take the boards by my school's deadline, which isn't the biggest concern since I can push this back, but I'm afraid that it'll take me like a whole year or two to actually get through all the material I need to know for the boards at the rate im going. I'm even more afraid of entering clerkships, which will require me to muster all my physical and mental energy. i just don't see myself getting through that right now because I'm *constantly* tired and dozing off mid-day, despite sleeping over 8 hrs everyday.  

it's even more frustrating because i care too much about what others think when i shouldn't and I'm worried people will see this as me being stupid and not understanding the material. and i hate myself for caring about it but idk i just cant seem to not care because my whole life, a big identity for me was being intelligent - i went to a top university, received high scores on exams, mcat, etc - and its hard for me to give that up i guess. I've honestly gotten past the point of hating myself for not being a ""top student"" anymore. at this point, i just want to be a normal, functioning human again. i just want to be able to put in a few hrs of my day to dedicated study time and feel like I've learned something. I'm so frustrated and i have no idea what to do with my life and i feel like I'm so close to giving up on medical school in general. i just want to sleep all day and watch youtube or netflix for hours on end. i don't really care about accomplishing anything with my life, which i KNOW is the depression talking, but i don't have the strength to say no. I'm just so tired. 

this ended up being a longer rant/post than i had wanted it to so i apologize for that. unfortunately, my current situation doesn't really allow me to take time off. but id appreciate any thoughts or stories from folks who had similar experiences. ",0.171,0.115,0.714

depression,I’m lost ,"Long post. Throwaway. I feel extremely lost. It’s the only word I can use to describe myself and my mental state now. I’m lonely, I don’t trust my thoughts, I don’t trust myself, I don’t know what to believe, everything seems so confusing. I feel like I have an existential crisis everyday. It feels like there’s  a 100 things wrong and I don’t know where to start. Or maybe nothings wrong and I’m doing a mental compulsion. Or maybe it’s ADHD. Or maybe it’s anxiety? But even depression involves rumination? Or maybe it’s loneliness and I’m just used to doing this everyday?
See what I mean? 

I’m an Asian male graduating HS. For the past (since covid basically) I’ve felt this way I guess. I don’t know where I am I don’t know who I am I don’t know why I’m here I’m so lost I’m so disconnected 

Moved to a new in middle school. People there were quite rich and I felt like I didn’t fit in. Different culture to what I had grown up in. Or maybe just middle school. Had some friends though, lived near them.. I always felt .. up to date? “In”? Belonging? ??

 Anyway I lost all these friends after sophomore of high school (lockdown due to the pandemic began in freshman year.) now I’m done with my senior year… and haven’t had any friends since freshman year. (actually many people say we’re close but I still feel like no one actually knows me) 

I’m also in an extremely rigorous HS program so I feel like I never had time to make new friends, but in school everyone has their own groups and I just watch them from the outside. A few people say we’re close but I still feel like no one actually knows me? 

Maybe many teenagers are lonely in HS? Maybe these shitty 4 years have just been the teenage rite of passage? 

But I’ve sat at home every single day for the past few years, feeling alone, scrolling Instagram, thinking about the past, scrolling YouTube, thinking about the future, watching Netflix, thinking about dying. That can’t be normal right? Analysing what went wrong with my life, feeling disconnected from the rest of my school, analysing analysing analysing. 

Horrible relationship w dad(ongoing, mom and I were physically abused by him(not ongoing). After watching a Jordan Peterson (haha maybe a mistake. Even that I don’t know.) I’ve coming to the realisation that it’s highly likely I repress my masculinity a lot because I don’t wanna be my father (hate showing anger, say I’m friends with a girl when I actually like her, much more etc.) 

Analysing everyday all day. Maybe the biggest problem is that I’m epically lonely but I’m too afraid to admit that? Maybe that’s the truth? Or maybe not? Oh - woah there is it just OCD? Because I doubt everything to the point I feel I’m going insane? Wait but even depression includes rumination, and I wasn’t suffering before 2 years ago?…ahh here we go again. 

Anxiety? Depression? OCD? Rumination? CPTSD? ADHD? Sleep apnea? Low iron? Confirmation bias? Brain fog? Maybe Long Covid? LONELINESS????

All day on Reddit all day ruminating…I watch therapy in a nutshell, better ideas, 100 days of unucking your life. And nothing ever happens. I’m not consistent with therapy or the gym. It just feels like wtf am I doing this for? Who am i doing this for? Maybe I’m a loser with no discipline. Life just seems is insanely complicated. It seems not worth it. It feels static. It feels empty. It’s like I know all my problems, but I don’t know what to fix or how to fix it and everyday I just keep…analysing them. Or maybe it’s just loneliness and I haven’t had the time or energy to make new friends to keep me occupied???? How do I know???????????????? I can’t trust myself????
Spending all day googling. Losing my sanity? I feel like I’m paralysed. Stuck. Existing. No free will. But I do right? But then why don’t I just move on? But everything’s so scary and I’m so lost. Am I just scared of all this independence. wtf man. ",0.116,0.194,0.69

depression,Nothing will ever be what it used to be.,"Life started out fine enough. I grew up in a beautiful place, with parents who loved and cared for me as well as they could. But homeschooling me started the snowball effect. In early elementary school I was motivated by trying to be better than everyone around me. Doing that from home fucked me up for four years as I became lazy and uninterested. Then high school came and since my parents were paranoid about the public school system, they put me in a private school where I was the outcast around everyone else who basically grew up with each other. Thankfully I got through it and graduated.

College was great. Best years of my life. For the first time in a few years, I had motivation. I pushed through all my classes and graduated with my Bachelor’s in Accounting by the time I was 21. I met my now-wife shortly afterward…and that’s where things began to go back to where they were. After we got married and the honeymoon period wore off,  I became complacent again. I would bounce around between jobs just trying to make enough to survive while being with someone who would end up spending more than she made and never accept criticism (even if it was constructive).

After moving to a new state and finally finding a solid career, COVID happened and it changed my wife even further. Instead of being more bubbly and outgoing, she eventually became uninterested in anything and isolated herself from others. At least before I enjoyed hanging out with new people and I was good at conversing with them. And it also led to her being way more paranoid about being away from me and not letting me do anything I was interested in. She keeps me from maintaining friendships and gets angry if I speak to anyone she doesn’t approve of.

Fast forward three years and it has only gotten worse. Now we’re in a house that needs a lot of renovation (as we got kinda screwed in the deal to begin with), we are constantly broke because she can’t stop buying things she won’t use, and despite my career going well, I feel like everything I make just goes to funding her lifestyle choices. Now she wants to add a kid into the mix but we’d have to go through IVF to get there.

I’ve thought about running away for the last couple of years, and that thought has only amplified the last few weeks as I am just so sick of this cycle. But then what comes next? I don’t have any dreams anymore. I don’t have any desire to carry forward with anything. I just go to work for the paycheck these days. About the only thing that keeps me excited is watching hockey, but that season is about to end and my summers always end up really boring.

Most days now I just don’t even want to wake up and deal with life. But I feel like I’m stuck. I don’t even have the courage to kill myself if I wanted to. There’s no finality to anything. So it just feels like even though I eventually will die, I just wish it would happen already.

depression,My life is over. ,"TW: Suicidal

As the title states my life is over whether I like it or not. This is how my story plays out. 

Back in October/November last year I began noticing small errors at work. It got to the point of where I was becoming the butt of jokes.

In December, I ended up talking to my PCP about this. He referred me to a neuropsychologist who ended up giving me a 4 hour assessment.  This assessment took place in January.  The results came in February.  At the time I had no clue what this even was. Mild Cognitive Impairment. For those that don't know MCI is the beginning stages of dementia. There are 7 stages, of which MCI is #3. 
I have been so depressed about all of this. It feels like there is no stop. The only way forward is to walk into the void where over time, I will most likely become a monster, a bitter old man all the time while my brain is deteriorating. 

For reference,  I'm 44, single, never married,  no kids. I will most likely have to face this alone. There's a point however, where I'll just become a shell of what I once was. My question is what happens then? What happens when I can no longer care for myself?

I begin speaking with social workers in June. ",0.062,0.116,0.822
depression,I hate myself and I don’t know if I will ever not hate myself ,"I feel like such trash. All my life since I was barely out of diapers I felt horrible about myself. I was always feeling alone and empty and gray inside ever since I can remember. I just wanted to grow up and get away from my depressing lonely family of origin. I wanted to get away from the lonely feeling in my head. I feel like I never truly will. 

I wanted to be a wife and a mom so much. I feel I failed at that. I picked someone who seemed like a good person but turned out not to be. Trying to stick with him so hard to fulfill that happy family fantasy, it turns out that I failed to give my kids the kind of childhood that they deserved—stable with stable parents.  I wish someone had told me that keeping the marriage together was not necessarily good for the kids. But I thought it would be. For the 20 years I was married, the man i was married too turned out to be a psychologicaly  abusive master of deception. I became a master of self-deception so I wouldn’t have to face how crappy the marriage was. I kept pretending it was ok how he was acting. It was not ok. And the kids had to see that I was being torn down and had to see me scream and melt down due to reactive abuse. 

The fact that I had meltdowns was not ok—meltdowns I had because I felt in my bones that something was really wrong with the way he treated me but I would never consciously admit it. And  the meltdowns just became the further reason to hate myself and be anxious for his approval and love. Which never came. He never loved me. He wanted me to be a step ford wife and I was too stupid to see it. It blighted my kids childhood. 

The kids are doing…ok. They struggle. They have mental health issues. It seems like they’ll manage their issues and have ok lives. But I wanted life to be better than ok for them. Not worse,  than my own lonely childhood. I married someone who I thought was a kindhearted and authentic person who morphed into a judgmental, superficial person and for years on end I was so convinced he was going return ro being that kind sweet person. I lied to myself and I betrayed myself in order to justify staying with him despite the abuse. I’m so angry at myself for letting myself down like that. 

Sometimes I just wish I could cease to exist. There’s no Time Machine. I can’t salvage the kids’ childhood years. Those years are gone. I want a do over so badly. ",0.143,0.197,0.659

depression,Can you ever really escape depression? Do some people just have a resting state of depressed?,"i (F22) have been depressed since i was 12. over the last 10 years, my depression has taken on many forms. in my teen years, i was super high-functioning, reckless and was incapable of caring about what i was doing to myself. then at 19 i went through a traumatic period that gave me cptsd symptoms and a chronic illness and i felt completely a shell of who i was. on auto pilot for 2 years feeling desperately stuck, but could not find help. afterwards, i could not recognise myself at all. was too anxious to leave the house for groceries. procrastinating going to the bathroom for hours. i worked on myself a lot. really actively worked on getting better and reaching out for help every way i could. choosing happiness everytime and constantly assessing what is good for my mental health. i did get better but it felt like i was constantly fighting the resting state of depression. eventually it led to me being admitted to the psychiatric ward because one week it all came crashing down extremely hard and i couldnt handle the idea that this excrutiating fight, might be a fight forever.   
that was a major turning point. after 21 years of feeling like no one was taking care of me and always having expectations, the nurses gave me so much love conditionless and it brought me back to rationality. i really felt my inner child really healed in that week alone. i came out to my loving ex-boyfriend who really understood the ins and outs of depression though he had never experienced it himself (which i dont think ive ever met anyone like that other than him by the way). i made amazing progress in a very short amount of time in hindsight. i really put in so much work to reworking my thought patterns and i kept myself SO busy. barely had a moment to myself. vacations terrified me, because just one hour in a train alone and i feel like i can fall off in a depressive spiral.   
i eventually graduated 6 months ago and i wanted to take a break and take a month to rest and implement some healthy habits to lose some trauma weight (i gained 20kgs in 3 months). but within a week of being by myself, i fell into a massively paralysing depressive episode. somehow even worse than the pre-psych ward episode and ive been in it for 6 months. i now have parents that take care of me everyday and a doctor that calls me twice a day. and i just don’t know how to keep doing it. it feels like i am always ‘fighting’. every day, i have to actively choose happiness. i cry all the time, i have ridiculous anxiety, i can’t seem to hold a pencil without feeling unworthy. i slept 17 hours straight last night. like wtf?i have fleeting moments of okayness which feel blissful. and i think i could probably hook on to those moments to just busy up my day where i can run from myself. but i feel like my attempts at getting better have always been like this and it feels like building on unsteady foundation and everytime i fall, i crash even harder.   
i just want to be okay. it feels impossible.   
(also something to note is i have been in many traumatic situations. since i was young till just 3 months ago. i have attracted trauma of many kinds and im sure that is something that impedes my healing process. but i would say i am good about processing those emotions after the major trauma i experienced at 19. for the last year at least, it feels like those things have definitely carved out neural pathways that take me to negative places. my ex-boyfriend said, “you’re a professional trauma experiencer so if anyone can help themself and fight this, you can”. )",0.184,0.159,0.657
depression,"I lost my job and I'm at home, which is what I always wanted, but this has made things worse.","It all started with the change in the attitude of someone at my workplace, where I loved working and getting a good paycheck, with whom I went out to dinner every day and whom I thought we were friends with, towards me. She bullied me every day and talked bad about me behind my back. At first I didn't understand anything, I couldn't understand what was going on. I realized later, but it was too late; I suddenly realized that everyone at work had an ""attitude"" towards me. It was as if I had done something very shameful and people had turned away from me.  But I didn't know why people treated me like this. What had I done? I had no idea. Every day I cried inwardly and I knew something was wrong, but I had no idea what it was. Why my friend had suddenly started to change towards me, and I didn't know how to react.

I had allowed everyone who felt entitled to bully me at work to trample me, and I had put myself in a much worse situation. I could stand up to them, I could not let them treat me badly, but I am a timid and a bit cowardly(!) person and it is not easy for me to stand up to people. Even a girl who just started working can be a bully towards me, who has been working for years. But I realized that when something bad happened to me, no one was standing by me. No one had my back, but they always had each other's back.  If I had reacted, no one would have said, ""Oh, this girl is right,"" they would have said, ""Who knows what she did to be subjected to this treatment."" When this first happened, everyone's attitude towards me changed for the worse. What one person said about me was enough for them to feel hostility towards me. But if I did the same thing, no one would even care about me. But those who treated me badly were always justified.

 I was now completely depressed when this reality hit me in the face. I still suffer from anxiety and depression right now. I didn't go to the doctor, but I'm pretty sure that's what's happening. It's very difficult to sleep at night. I can't eat, I cry all the time and I'm having a hard time pulling myself together. I just do things to numb myself, I get lost on the internet all day long, then I can feel like I don't exist. I wasn't a very healthy person mentally, but I can say that these recent events have made everything worse. I lost my respect at work, my job, and my great salary, and I can't find a new job. 

And I don't want to go to the jobs my mom found me because I know that I'll go through the same thing. I don't want to go through the same thing. I'm in such a bad state mentally. I know that the world is not going to change for me and I don't want to relive the things that have been destroying me for years. But being unemployed and not being able to do what I want anymore is too heavy for me. This is not the life I'm used to, but it's too hard to fight anymore. I want to resign from life, I want to go somewhere where I don't have to worry about anything.

 I feel suicidal, I think about killing myself every day. I know that everything is my fault and that I messed up a bag of figs, and now I want to get rid of myself. I don't like people because all I see from them is disrespect and evil at the end of the day. Every day I think about how I should do it if I were to push my off button one day. Living is very difficult now.",0.084,0.243,0.673
depression,I'm just tired of life (very long read),"I feel like I have horrible luck, as in just about everything I do it almost always goes the wrong way I want it to. I try and try to remain as kind as possible to people but then again I dislike when people bother me. I'm fine with small talk but unless you are very close to me I am not looking to have a whole conversation with you. This year I have decided to become more distant in every aspect due to all I faced. I know I'm not perfect—I'm short, I'm ugly, I'm awkward and have anxiety. I'm a poc. People have tons of reasons to hate on me and many usually do. 

I'm tired of the public and people. I'm tired of interacting with others and entertaining them. I hate to push the good people away but majority of the time I just want to be left alone. I'm tired of all the mistreatment. I am not a social person and for good reason. Alot of people like to assume they have me figured out when they don't know a damn thing about me.

There's so much already I have to deal with: tons of debt, work stress, stress when being outside and anxiety. Being judged at all times. People like to say things like ""noo people don't have time to worry about you!"" or ""put yourself out there!"" but these things don't work. Alot of people certainly make time to make slick comments and show off to their cliques. Others make fun of you and treat you horribly when you attempt to be open and condemn you when you isolate. No matter what I did I was never winning any battles.

I face so much vitrol when I generally do things ALONE. I handle my business ALONE—no begging, no leeching, no cheating my way out of things. All this as I sit and watch those around me remain judge-free when they act worse than  me. I don't bother others, I keep to myself I try to be nice and kind as I can to people and I hardly receive it back in return. It's what I get for being born ugly and short I suppose, things I had almost no control over. It's crazy how genetics can affect our lives so much in every aspect. In fact I'll go through each category.

People judge me for being a homebody and having no friends and hanging out but when I attempt to be in the open I get criticized and backtalked and taken advantage of. Why would I continue to ruin my mood and entertain that. I dislike being around phony people so most of the time I isolate unless I'm forced to be around others. I'm already boring and I now like to warn people about it beforehand so they don't get surprised. 

People judge me for not having a gf/relationship and insinuate your sexual orientation but it's like I'm already ugly and very short height for a man so I literally already don't have it easy. I have nothing to brag about I literally have never ever been in a relationship or had anyone actually interested in me that way. I try to be as nice and kind as I can to people and most of the time I'll have other women being rude to me. Even if I keep to myself or attempt to be friendly—nope, doesn't matter since they just have to be rude since no attraction is there. I hate how shallow this world is. People who don't judge ugly people and treat them horrible off the bat is a rare instance in this society it seems. 

Even common courtesy is lacking when I'm out. Almost everyone is so spiteful and venemous. Then people wonder why we like to be alone. They will wonder and then they will judge. I've had my fair share of time being outdoors and whereever I go to enjoy myself I always face the bad parts of lookism. ",0.134,0.22,0.647

I'm an adult now and I still come home amd think ""i might get in trouble for coming home late"" no I won't.

I feel like I can't do anything else. How am I supposed to go another 60 years living like this? Why did my entire life get fucked up because 2 teenagers couldn't keep it in their pants? Why am I suffering at the hands of the people who were supposed to be my protectors? Sometimes I just wish I was normal. I wish I didn't self sabotage, I wish I could go out without feeling guilty for being out, I wish I could drop something without immediately freezing and seeing if I'm going to get in trouble. I wish I could deal with my anger in a normal way and not like my father. I wish I could communicate better than my mother did. But I'm stuck.

How am i supposed to want to live this life if I can't even grow up like everyone my age? Why do I feel like I'm the only one struggling to adapt? Is it just a me problem? I miss the girl I thought I was going to be. I miss that I had life goals not just career ones. I miss when I was excited about landing and going to my job, and excited when I could hang out with my friends, even just being excited I could eat a nice dinner. But everything feels like a chore. Everything. Waking up, eating, walking my dog, going to work, playing video games. I can't seem to find any happiness in anything anymore. And honestly I'm afraid I won't come back from it this time.

depression,Been put on antidepressants for suspected depression but I think I'm bipolar,"Let me give some backstory. I'm fairly young, tried to ignore my sadness and over energised mood swings for the past two years and just tired to act ""normal"". Things had been going good for close to 6 months but winter came along (I don't live in America) and all of my progress reversed, I can't get out of bed, am sleeping way too much, not eating nearly enough and just got out of the psychiatric hospital and I think I have to go back if I want to get better. I only have ever seeked help when I feel down but I (maybe half the time, more or less) feel normal or even great, the start of my year was amazing, just for no real reason I feel horrible and depressed.

Here is my main issue/question. I believe I have bipolar and when I went to the hospital to treat my depression they, of course, thought I was depressed. So they've put me on antidepressants since last week, I haven't felt any change yet and they said that was normal, but I'm scared that once they start working they'll work too well and push me into a manic like state which I've experienced a lot over the past couple years.

My gf tells me that there's nothing wrong with me and that I ""just have ADHD."" I know she means well by that but it kinda hurt me.

Fresh out of high school me and my mom worked together to build a place we hoped could free us from the shackles of wageslavery. Something we built ourselves named ourselves and spent years working on. And this is my last week, I only have three shifts left operating this place.

I’ve been burned out for a while now, a year at least, and at first knowing we were gonna close was a weight off my shoulders. I was afraid of finding another job but knowing I could have some time off was a relief.

depression,How to help your partner in depression,"Hi, My boyfriend and I’ve been together for over 4 years. And just recently he told me that he’s been depressed this semester and would like some space starting now. I asked what I can help him with and he said nothing as of now and that he would like to spend time with his friends and himself to work on feeling like himself again. He also said he’s been seeking therapy. He said I can text him, just don’t expect responses. And the call ended. We are in a semi long distance relationship. 

I’m willing to wait, I want to understand and give him the space he needs. It would be a lie if I say that I’m not affected at all. I’m honestly hurt and he hasn’t expressed anything before so this was very sudden and I’m in a big pain that he had to go through it alone, not wanting to seek help from me, and I had no idea, and he had to wear a mask around me. It hurts.

Some reddit posts I’ve read said I should try to not associate this situation personally because depression is ass and it’s not what he means. I’m trying.

I left him a message and said to “like” the message if he doesn’t want me to contact him more often than weekly (sorry weird grammar). I told him to “love” the message if he’s okay with a daily text (not expecting a response or anything, just a simple message).

So I would like any insights/advice as much as I could get. Is it okay to give just neutral life updates then? Or should I just stay out of his life for a bit? Anything would help. Please thank you ",0.13,0.094,0.777

depression,5AM Crisis,"This is a long post, I’m sorry.. so I’m a 23 y/o woman, been graduated from college for about a year. I’ve applied for hundreds of jobs and haven’t gotten anything, which makes me feel like I don’t have any real skills or knowledge. Just been bouncing around mediocre jobs that make me feel bad about myself and I have no money. Besides my lack of success, another huge motivation for me in life is love. But I haven’t had any meaningful relationships in the past 5 years. I mean, I’ve definitely loved 3 people but I found out I didn’t mean anything to them, which is kind of my fault for falling in love after 4 months each time when they never made a commitment to me. I’ve done my fair share of dating and it feels like there’s no one for me here in this city. On top of that, my situation with my family has been hard. My dad, who I used to think of as my best friend, is very selfish and is not giving to our family, although he is very generous to everyone outside of our family (for example, loaning people thousands of dollars just for them to never pay him back, paying for girlfriends’ phones, trips, etc.) My two younger sisters don’t respect me and I’m often the odd one out in everything when we’re all together. For the past year I’ve done everything in my power to try to make us closer: quality time, gifts, rides to their friends houses, letting them use my car to learn how to drive, etc. but they only call each other, only post each other, and they hang out without me all the time without caring. And then there’s the relationship with my mom… the rockiest one of all my family. After 10 years of our tumultuous relationship, my mom has gotten married and has been living with her husband, a man that I hate, for the past year.. She has consistently prioritized that relationship over me and convinced my whole extended family that I’m crazy for disapproving. They speak a different language than me too so I can’t really express my side of the story to them either. But basically since he’s there, I don’t feel welcome at that house. All and all, what I hate the most about it is how they all think of me, I can’t fight it anymore I’m just tired of trying. I don’t feel like trying to be friends with my sisters, I don’t feel like trying to be good with my mom, and being under the same roof with my dad has got me sick too. All of this has just been making me think: what’s the point? I don’t see myself becoming successful, my family situation is bad, I’m broke, unlucky in love, very little friendships, I kind of want to end it. I’m conflicted though because I do love life, I love music, concerts, travel, movies… but I really can’t see over the road block of everything else. I probably don’t come off as very likable but guys I’m having suicidal ideation at 4:30 in the morning can you blame me? You might be thinking, maybe I’m the problem, which you could be right!

I always tell people “I love you” because I feel like that’s what others would want to hear but I don’t mean or feel it when I say it it’s just a natural response.

depression,Found out the girl I liked and spent so much time with in HS was promiscuous.,"For years I've had this girl built up in my head as this really kind, innocent girl. I even had many dreams where she visited me like an angel for years, but that conception was shattered into oblivion today.

I haven't seen or talked to her in years, but I still think about her from time to time, looking at her socials to see if there is any new development in her life. She has an Instagram with like five photos. She became a wife, and had a kid in her early twenties. Basically settled down and started a traditional life.

Looking her up out of curiosity, I found an old Instagram account of hers that I had never een before...

In it she had photos proudly calling herself a ""bimbo"", ""hoe"", etc. One photo showed her legs, with bruises all over, and she replied to some guy ""too many blowjobs"". This was around the same time I was still hanging out with her, around a decade ago. In fact, I went to see the new Star Wars movie just a few weeks after that post.

She also had liked a handful of replies from men thirsting after her in other photos.

Even though we never were a couple, she was the first girl I fell hard for. I was more romantic and innocent about it, and got to know her over a several years period as a friend. I one day confessed my feelings to her, and was rejected/friendzoned.

I had assumed she was a relatively innocent girl, from our conversations, but boy was I wrong. She was telling me a truth inconsistent with these facts.

I am devastated that my first crush, the one who is imprinted on my mind like a tattoo you deeply regret, turned out to be a slut. I wish so badly I could Eternal Sunshine my mind and forget she ever existed.

I haven't had as much female attention in my life after her, so she has kind of been my only reference I can recall.

I feel like the good memories are now forever tainted with this knowledge. It was like opening Pandoras box. I have spent the day crying off and on, and can't fall asleep now. 

I literally feel like throwing up thinking how she was going around and sleeping with different guys, but wouldn't entertain the idea of having a relationship with me, even though we spent so much time together.

Maybe it's good. It might be the closure I never got, and burst the bubble of infatuation I had. But boy fuckin howdy, it stings like a bitch all the same...",0.153,0.1,0.746

depression,talking to people,"I have nothing to say now. I have no friends, i ghosted the only friend left to me.

I don't draw anymore, i can't bring myself to read anymore, even the fucking video games i used to obsess over when i was younger feel like a fucking chore. I cant even think most days. I don't do anything. I am ashamed of my empty life. The only people i can't escape are my family. Oh, i can pretend well enough to be a normal person for short, meaningless conversations, but whenever they ask me questions about myself that i cant avoid its over. I cant keep living like this. I am so tired of being like this. I am growing to hate my family. Not their fault of course, but they make me so anxious and self-conscious, that i dont feel safe around them anymore.

Well, all of this has been sparked up by the fact that my aunt invited me to have a drink and hang out with her today, the kind of invitation you cant refuse otherwise shell come to your house and be like oh why didnt you come with me? Why did you refuse? Do you hate me? And i just dont know what to do. She is not a stupid woman. She might know. She will ask me questions. I dont know what to do here.

depression,Fighting depression.,"Hey. 24m here. I've been fighting depression since early 2019. Fought with it for almost 5 years, and I was suicidal. In 2021, I left my parents home in a turmoil and been through a lot of dark times since then. Until I started my therapy in January 2024.

Therapy has been great, and I'm slowly, gradually changing my path towards the light. It's been 5 months only, but I'm really seeing the changes in myself. And that's great.

Although, I'd like to state that I'm still lonely as ever. I'd love some company but as an introvert, who's struggling with self worth issues, it's hard. So I'm looking for advice to how to cope with loneliness, or how to go out talk to people. Also, I hope I could find some supportive companion here. That'll be great.

But that's not in my control. What's in my hands is to change myself. And I've noted down a few things I'd like to do for the next week. And then again the next week, and so on and so forth. Here's the list.

No p*rn
Exercise and jog
60 gms of protein everyday 
3 meals daily 
8 hrs sleep at night 

Fighting depression, or any other mental Illness is tough. Really tough. If anyone's here struggling, just know that I'd love to talk to you. And if you're past that stage, I'd like to know your story too!

See you guys in a week.

depression,I feel so stuck and don’t know why I bother trying,"I’m kind of scared of making this post since I don’t want anyone I know potentially seeing it.

But to start, I’ve been feeling this way for a very long time. Ever since I was around 7 years old. I know the things I’ve gone through can’t be compared to the things that happened to all of you. You’re all adults or teens who’ve gone through unfair, horrendous things and are forced to maintain your lives despite how debilitating depression is. But me? The catalyst for all of this was being bullied.

There’s more to it than that, but that’s all it is if I were to simplify it.

I don’t know, I just woke up today and my brain decided to remind me of all these small details that absolutely destroyed me, but I just decided to hide how sad I actually felt. I realized that my parents haven’t told me “thank you” whenever I tried to help them in a long time. I realized that they became more hostile and passive aggressive to me (and my sister). I remembered all the times they piled a bunch of instructions onto me and expected me to figure out when and how I’m supposed to do it all. 

I’m 17, I’m supposed to be trying to figure out what to do with my life, but I’m just tired of waking up in the mornings. I just want to sleep in, and when I do wake up, I want things to be how I wish they could be. I want to get messages from people checking in and asking if I’m doing better. I want to feel the presence of all the animals I had to give away when we moved, and I want to hear my bird basically a screaming in the mornings for me to wake up.

depression,worried i might still be depressed,"i went through a period of depression during this past winter and i thought it was just seasonal depression so i never worried too much about it. i looked forward to the spring because i thought i would feel happier. the issue is my sadness and hopelessness from the winter went away, but now i just feel disconnected from my emotions.

theres been several moments where id be laughing with my friends and notice that theyre all howling with laughter but im just forcing my laugh. it makes me feel disconnected from my relationships.

i recently had my last 2 theater performances and senior sendoff for my theater troupe. at the end of all 3 events, people were crying either because it was their last show or their friends were graduating. i cried a lot, but i just didnt really feel connected to my emotions. theater is the most important thing in my life and i felt like i wasnt sad enough about it ending- i even mentioned before the sendoff that i was worried i wasnt going to cry enough. now that the sendoff is over, i dont feel much at all about it.

im a naturally sensitive person and ive always worn my heart on my sleeve, so it worries me that i feel disconnected from my emotions and because of that- my relationships have been negatively impacted. i didnt think that the cause could be depression until i saw people online saying it might be a sign of it. has anyone else experienced this? is there a way to start feeling more? thanks!

depression,feeling frozen in time,"Feel like everyone who ends up leaving me genuinely feels a lot happier without my presence. My ex childhood best friend of 10 years is posting photos of herself on instagram and she’s truly never looked as beautiful and happy as she does now. Her face is glowing brighter than glass and her smile is bigger than the moon and i couldn’t hate her more for it. 

I just wonder why I can’t move on and why Im stuck on my past relationships with people and why I can’t form any new friendships. Maybe because nobody even possibly compares to the relationship I had with her. I genuinely feel like it’s impossible for me to ever connect with someone again. I haven’t had a face to face real conversation to anyone besides my mom for a year. And I don’t think I have any desire to because it all feels so fucking hopeless because nobody I ever talk to I like. Everyone feels so entirely distant and cold. Everything is heavy so heavy and I hate it all. 

I wish I never took my friendships for granted and I wish I didn’t let them fade out and I wish I spoke up about how much they meant to me but I could never find the words but now I do but it’s too late. Nothing can be rekindled because what’s done is done and when its done its never coming back. What hurts a lot is how her and the other person in our little friend group who I introduced to are still very close. they enjoy eachothers presence more than mine. 

I wish i could learn to like someone without becoming addicted to them. I wish there was a blur between those two things for me but there isnt. It always goes to obsession and it’s exhausting and i rather talk to nobody at all than to deal with all of it again.

Today my friends went to lunch without me and I had to search around all the campus cafeterias for them and when I waved to them one of my friends didn't wave back. She stared at me blankly and I kept waving and she didn't wave back. I feel like she hates me. Group conversations make me want to kill myself because I can't talk or connect with others unless the conversation is about a topic I care about, like vidya I play, movies or shows I watch, or cyber security or animes I watch.

I feel so isolated due tp my childhood as well. I feel like a crappy person for saying this but I envy peoples happy childhoods. Everyone talks about childhood friends or happy school memories and I have nothing to talk about besides cutting myself in the school bathrooms in middle school or feeling depressed 24/7 until 19. I became better in college, making friends, but I still feel like I am unable to connect with others truly.

I feel like an android, in a sea of humans. Social cues are like something I can never grasp, to feel truly human, is something impossible for a machine like me. It's an inside joke, of millions of years of evolution, something I can never grasp.

Maybe I'm overthinkinking but I fear the same thing is going to happen again. They'll find out I'm a depressing, boring, insecure, terrible person. They'll find out that I'm not a human, but a machine, and They'll abandon me and exile me and I'll be back to being alone again.

depression,My relationship ending has seriously heightened my depression.,"I recently went through a pretty bad an unexpected break up which my ex made it seem like it was because of the way I would sometimes speak to her and some of the arguments we would have. One night in the middle of March I woke up around 2-3 am and I had the nasty gut feeling that something terrible had happened behind my back and felt to need to call her and her phone went directly to voicemail (which never happens) . This made me extremely insecure deep down and one thing I can say is my intuition is VERY strong, so I knew there was something going on. I just couldn’t bring it up or make any statement because I didn’t have the evidence. We ended up having a big argument and broke up.

Maybe it’s a coincidence, bad luck, karma, or a warning that what we ask for is what we get (sort of)... I don’t know, but I find it strange as I’ve wished for death more this year than a normal person ever would in a lifetime. I won’t be wishing for anymore accidents. My entire body is aching and although the accident was not my fault, it’s still going to cost me a bit of money and certainly a lot of stress and inconvenience. Do not wish for accidents.",0.189,0.257,0.555
depression,My friends hate me,"We we're all supposed to attend a convention this weekend together and I was supposed to ride down with two people from our group. The rest are flying. The one driving decided at the last second I'm not allowed to be in his car anymore. He apparently made the decision to kick me weeks ago but waited til the last second to ensure i didnt attend the event.It's too late to buy a flight and rental cars aren't any cheaper with the price of gas. I am forced to cancel. None of my friends lift a finger to help me. I reach out to as many people as possible and they all tell me oh well. Sucks for you. We're gonna have fun without you now so bye!! I'm all but forgotten about.

This event was the only thing I had to look forward to. Especially since I've been on a massive depression spiral since last year and I knew it was a well needed weekend because i haven't felt excited about anything in months
Just a few days of escape. A few fleeting days to not feel like a miserable piece of shit and maybe smile. But not for me. I don't deserve it.

All I've done since Monday is cry. I get a few hours where I'm not but I always end up crying. Anytime anywhere. I can't stop it. 

There's no point in being alive if I can't even be excited anymore. That I'm not allowed to be part of a group. I'm not allowed to have friends. My only purpose is to waste resources and take up space

depression,I Feel Devoid of All Good,"Hi I’m a M 25 and I am blind.  For a long time I’ve struggled with depression I think it’s related to my mind’s chemistry and trauma/abuse I faced in childhood. However for a long time I’ve had the feelings under control. My anger still slipped here and there which used to fuel my depression as I felt the world was unjust.  I had really good ways of coping and I still haven’t reached the levels of depression I had when younger.  However, just today I faced a situation I’ve faced often in my life. I try to do the right thing and I’m always the one being treated like a jerk.  I won’t go into detail but I had screenshots of the person being mean to several people without anyone else being mean back or starting thee conversation mean. The person used their position at this organization to leverage thee bacjkjlllash at another and someone who was super disrespectful and that many reported not only didn’t get in trouble she got a paise post.  

So now I’m just feeling like this happens all the time and for the longest time I’ve know the world is ignorant but a little part of me believed there was hope for change. But now at age 25 I’m thinking of resigning from the non-profit I’m executive director at.  I went to dinner tonight with friends and couldn’t focus on anything but the negative of people. Even the people I love I barely want to be around. My life isn’t terrible by any means and this situation with the lady is a common occurrence but for some reason today it made me start to think about how I don’t believe in the good of people anymore.  For the longest grind I e known my anger and depression were a destructive cocktail brewed up by the bullying I faced and the trauma I endured before adoption and I’ve worked to make progress with psychologists and counselors. But I’m starting to think that most of it isn’t me. That these people really do suck like I thought before and my heart can’t handle the corruption I see people get away with. Or the ways people can be so mean to others.  That’s just not like me I’ve been angry but I’ve never insulted someone or attacked them personally.   If good is out there in the world I think a switch in me flipped today that turned it all off because I don’t see it anymore and I’m not sure I ever will again. ",0.112,0.153,0.735

depression,"Can’t move on from toxic ex, and it’s ruining my life.","I (25m) am having issues moving on from my ex (36f). She was married when I met her, and she’s from Philippines. She love bombed me and bought me lots and lots of expensive gifts and would give me money.

I broke up again, and it was met by 100s of calls, texts, emails. I used to play guitar, write music, be happy and now my mind is constantly thinking of her, and when I find myself getting feelings over her again, I lash out and get angry, blame and blame her for everything. I just want to get out of this rut, I want to be happy again, but I only ever feel guilt of being a bad person because of this relationship.

depression,Feeling alone in a crowd…,"
I feel that, unseen, unheard. My chest aches, bipolar 1, misdiagnosed for 10 years, now better since 1 and a half.

But still I am way behind in life. My peers avoid me or dont talk to me because of my academic struggles. They pity me, sometimes say hi here and there but they don’t befriend me. Some call me dumb ass, poor girl….

I am tired…. Gratitude doesn’t always help. My mood goes down spiraling 🌀 and then I can’t study or focus. I already have willpower, focus issues. 

Life I guess isn’t fair…. Maybe my suffering to me is real and painful….

But its unbearable sometimes . Some days people mistreat for nothing and see me as if I don’t exist, as if I am vapour… I am tired of being kind to myself…. 

I know there’s war, people going hungry and without proper homes to stay….

And I should consider their situation 

But it still hurts so bad… 

I ask God, is He testing me because this is the one thing I always ran after: academic achievement 

Is it because the afterworld is better than the present world? Is it because there’s is wisdom in everything. And I don’t know the Unseen goodness in it.

Is it because there’s reward for this pain no matter how small it might seem to others, my whole heart seems to burst out of this overwhelming pain. That everyday is different. There’s still blessings a lot of them, but my main struggle is there always each day showing up in different ways….

depression,I’m tired,"Just the title. 

23M I’ve been dealing with depression since as far back as I can remember. I’ve been medicated heavily before back when I was in grade school. Told my parents then that I didn’t like the way it made me feel and I didn’t want to take them any more. So I didn’t. I’m very much against going back onto psych meds. 

I’m (likely) autistic [mom is, dad is, sister is] was diagnosed as AD(H)D (ik add is an outdated term now) back when I was 8 lumped together with depression/anxiety disorder.  

I really don’t want to go through my life story here so I’m not going to. 

I’m not suicidal. Have SH’d before but long time ago. I didn’t have the worst childhood. My parents have been abusive in the past. They’ve since been to therapy and aren’t like that anymore towards me or each other, but they also haven’t acknowledged it. Or apologized for it. We also aren’t a super physically affectionate family. Though I crave physical intimacy constantly. Just never felt comfortable unless I was in extreme distress.

Work is work but lately I’ve been hating working in my department (only part time and recently got rejected for a full time position for someone who was already full time and had left that very same department before) I hate the instability with the hours given as it makes living on my own such a pain. And no I’m not going to work a second job, that isn’t the point. I shouldn’t HAVE to. I work well, I’m a solid worker but I can’t help but feel like I’m playing 5th fiddle against people who haven’t been there as long as me nor put in the same work ethic as me. I’m starting to feel like I don’t belong and I can’t do anything but THINK while I work alone in a hot ass room while my coworkers get to work in a chilled room with a speaker listening to music having fun and laughing and I can’t even have as much as one earbud in without managers getting up my ass. The most verbal interaction I get is the occasional “hey how’s it going” and that’s it. It’s so isolating and demoralizing. I get home and I want nothing more than to get stoned out of my mind and have some drinks (I do like getting crossed) 

I’ve been so out of it I have to force myself to shower sometimes. I don’t like looking at myself in the mirror. 

Google, with the shit I search, probably thinks I’m gonna up and KMS. 

I want to live another life. I’m so tired of being stuck in this same loop. I’m tired of struggling. I’m tired of wondering what other people think of me. I’m tired of putting myself out there only to get told that I suck and should get back to cooking more chickens. 

I want to live in another country. I want to explore the world but I can’t. 

There’s no point in talking, what’s the goal? 
There’s a billion plus 2 things to talk about but nothing to make it all fit into place. Because in the end we will all die and none of our words will have meant anything. 

I believe that this isn’t the only life to live. I believe that once I die I will live again. I may not even be a human in the next one. Or anything that resembles anything that we have ever seen on this earth. It may not even be earth. 

I’ve told my parents I don’t plan on having kids. Their family name dies with me. I wouldn’t want to raise a kid with all of my baggage. I wouldn’t want them to see how shitty we left it for them. I wouldn’t want for them to hate me for bringing them into this world.

All I seem to do is work, watch tv alone at home, and sleep. I feel like such a waste of a human and it’s utterly exhausting.
I used to have so hopes and goals… like even though I’ve been depressed and wished I was dead for as long as I can remember, there was always this tiny part of me that hoped I could be the person that “it gets better for”. I always held out on completing the deed because I had fomo of the possibility that maybe my life could get better like everyone kept saying
But now I’m 28 (which I know to some is not old at all) and I feel like I have no chance of it ever getting better. I see no light, and the fomo of the possibility of a light is not even really there anymore.

Recently my partner has been struggling with depression to the point where it affects every day between us.

depression,"Had enough with gaslighting, brainwashing father","I am a PhD student in South Korea, and I am struggling right now in life. I just need some support right now. To be more specific, I am struggling financially right now, and I believe I am suffering from depression. This all started from my father. Two years ago, my parents suddenly got divorced. My mother left us in a hurry and never spoke to us. I felt betrayed, so I stuck with my father, and decided to help him start his business again since his business was suffering because of Covid. For two years I had complete belief in my father, and I believed him to a model father whom I've always looked up to. However, last year, I felt something wrong when my wife went through a major surgery regarding her ovaries. I did some background research on my father and realised that he is very different from what I thought he was. He was brainwashing me ever since I was young, distancing me from everyone that he deemed not worthy in his eyes. My mother was being hysterical all the time when I was young, and she showed symptoms of bipolar disorder ever since I was growing up. However, it turns out that my father was causing those things since he was having affairs and gaslighting my mother into thinking that everything, every bad thing happening to our family was because of her and her disloyalty. Even when we left Korea and went to Singapore because my father was kicked out of his company that he created, I only believed that it was because of some bad investors that forced him out to get ownership of the company. I found out that it was because he had an affair and was also suspected of taking company money for himself illegally. Even when we went to Singapore, he had affairs, and afterwards, we all went to Philippines where his situation got worse. Of course, my mother's situation got worse as well. But I have always believed in my father because he was always bragging about him being a good father to us who works endlessly to support us. He created this boundary between us and the world, saying that he was the only protector against this world since the world does not understand us and will never be able to understand our intellect since we are such geniuses. 

Because of Covid, my father returned to South Korea. My parents finally got divorced, and I was the next target. For over 20 years, when my father had difficulties, it was my mother and my mother's sister who took out personal loans and helped him. However, my father always told us that my aunt was an evil person who only cared about money and had dirty personal life. Now it was my turn to become his bank. The company was not doing well, obviously. To survive, since I had two credit cards, I gave one to him and used one for my wife and me. I thought it was my duty. What we spent was too much for us to handle. So, I took out loans. I took out more loans last year to try and cover some of the expenses. My father tried some businesses here, but nothing worked out since he just sounded like a scammer and was so stubborn in making his businesses work the way he wants them to work. His health was also deteriorating immensely which gave me immense guilt. I paused my studies and did my best to support him. I sacrificed my time, my effort, and everything I could to try and support him. Despite not having any income, my father spent immensely. I thought it was due to the shock of his sudden divorce. However, my debts were piling up like crazy. 

One day, my father got in contact with one of his college juniors and made some business promises with him. The junior agreed to hire some of my father's employees who were studying in South Korea as well. The junior also agreed to hire me as well but since I am not specialised in the field of hardware engineering, they agreed to take me in for business management role. So of course I agreed. However, afterwards, the words changed, and they said I needed to study hardware engineering. I was flabbergasted, of course, but I had no choice. I agreed since I did not see any way out. In the end, I went for an interview in the junior's company, but of course I failed. Now, all the blame went to me. My father and his junior both told me that it was all my fault since I did not try hard enough to learn the necessary stuff. I was frustrated but I did not have any choice, so I thought that was the real problem. 

During this time, my mental state was a mess. I thought I was a failure. I thought I was a worthless piece of shit that did not know how to repay my father's efforts when he was dragging his sick body across the country to try and resurrect us. After that, I still wanted to try and help him, so I tried to make some new business that we could work on together. There was no progress since I basically stopped studying for around two years at this point and making a business, especially a financial service business, took a long time. But my father disagreed. He put the blame on me again. He said I was not trying enough and that I was not desperate enough to make some changes. I felt frustrated again, but there was nothing I could do. I accepted my fate and felt more and more depressed, thinking I was a failure. 

During this time, my father’s gaslighting and toxic behaviour came out more and more. I began to see myself as a failure, a failed person who had no hopes. Depression took over me, alcoholism took over me as well, and suicidal thoughts lingered in my head all the time. But of course, to my father, it was nothing. When I shared all these things to him, he would say it is the same for him. He would say that he is in a worse situation than me and that I have no right being whiny. He would say that I need to get my head out of the clouds and to “push for my dreams”. I did not have any dreams at that time anymore. How could I have dreams. During this time, with the promise from my father that things will get better soon, we purchased a car for myself, with full monthly payment. I am still trying to pay off the car purchase debt. And during this time, I got in contact with my mother, and she helped me financially even though she was not earning a lot herself as well. My mother also provided a lot of emotional support for me. If it wasn’t for her, I do not know what would have happened to me. My father did nothing. He pretended to be working, to be looking for projects and making some businesses, but he was doing nothing. His excuse was always his bad health. But he never even thought of working under a company or working as a freelancer or as a consultant when he had every opportunity to do so. He instead pushed all the work, duties, and responsibilities to me while making me feel like a useless piece of garbage that was too lazy to do anything. But even then, I thought I needed to make him happy. I believed it was my duty to do so. 

After my wife's surgery, I thought something was weird. We were struggling, not even having money to pay off the hospital fees, but my father was just happily spending a lot of money in Philippines, where he was trying to make some ""businesses"". So, I did some investigating, and found out about his past with my mother. The affairs he had, all the gaslighting and brainwashing he did on both my mother and I, and all the money related issues that I never realised about my seemingly wonderful father. Also, turns out, it appears that my father has a 4-year-old baby in the Philippines with some woman he met in a bar few years ago. It was incredulous as my father did mention something about it to me. He said back when we were living in Philippines, he had a big argument with my mother as usual and he got pissed and got drunk that he slept with a woman from a bar. What is even more incredulous is that he was even video calling the baby and the mother while my brother and I were both beside him and told us that it was a baby that he decided to adopt in the future since he always wanted to adopt a daughter. And now, he is back in the Philippines, and it turns out, he is spending immense amount of money there to support the baby and the mother while living a luxurious life there. Also, apart from the bar woman whom he allegedly has a baby with, there are numerous other women that he was “sleeping around” with. I have seen the photos and texts recently. Meanwhile, my wife and I are struggling to pay rent and other expenses. Recently, around 22 million KRW came in as a business project end-of-contract fee, but he spent all of it in the Philippines while he only gave me 4 million KRW to cover some of the 3-months delayed debts which he promised to take care of. I wonder where all the money went to. Also, some of that money is supposed to go to his previous employee who is now working in his junior’s company as a project fee, but my father only gave 1 million KRW when she was supposed to receive 5 million KRW. Incredibly, this was not the first time this had happened. There are numerous people he owes money to, but none of those borrowed money ever came to me. 

Of course, people will ask me, ""why didn't you get a job or get a part-time job to support yourselves?"" For two years, I was gaslighted into thinking that supporting my father will mean supporting us. I was gaslighted into thinking that making his business bloom means making our situation better. Also, I was gaslighted into thinking that it was my duty to take care of him since I was his son, and he was sick. I never doubted my father since he was an amazing person in my mind. Apart from that, due to my army programme in the graduate school, I did not have time to spend 9-6 in the lab, help with my father’s business, and do some part-time jobs. Of course, after I found out about all these things, I tried to get a job. I have been trying for a year, but nothing worked out due to several reasons. So, with all that, with great disappointment, betrayal, and immense pain I am feeling because of my father, I decided to just not give a shit about him. I will not consider him as my father anymore. I will find a part-time job at night to support myself and my wife. I will do whatever it takes to survive, and my so-called father will not be a part of my life anymore. I just wanted to share and rant. I guess I had enough.",0.089,0.117,0.794
depression,I'm fairly certain I'm depressed or maybe bipolar? I don't know and I don't know where to begin finding out,"I've had feelings of isolation, loneliness, self hatred, insecurity - the list could go on - for essentially as long as I can remember. Lately I've been feeling so hollow, I don't really care about anything but my cats. If I'm not at work I spend most of my time sleeping. Unless I can't sleep, then I end up staying up all night feeling completely alone and often times just fall into a hole of self hatred. I feel alone essentially all the time whether I'm with anyone or not. I don't really feel any kind of joy for more than a moment. I can still laugh and find humor in things around other people, but rarely do I actually smile anyone. I don't really have any kind of desires I don't want anything from anyone and at this point I only even really eat because I'm supposed to. I spend a decent amount of time crying. On days that I'm otherwise ""okay"" small triggers can set me off so easily. I either get angry, shut down completely, or become incredibly hurt. On some occasions I've had panic attacks. Once I become triggered it's difficult for me to come back to reality, and I sometimes won't for hours or days at a time I'll end up essentially on autopilot.

After taking the medication for about 3-4 months I can say that it hasn't really helped me in any way. I am now - after doing some research, talking to my fiance, and thinking about how I actually feel - wondering if I might have ADD. I don't believe I have AHDH because I am not hyperactive. I tend to be more unfocused, irritable, forgetful, tired, unproductive, lacking motivation, and sad. I know I cannot diagnose myself because I am not a doctor, but after reading and listening to others online talk about their ADD I am led to believe I have it. 

What would you recommend I do now and how can I know for sure if I have ADD or depression? Is this something only a psychiatrist could tell me. Have you tried alternate ways of fixing your ADD with things such as vitamins or just changing habits?

depression,Confused ,"I'm not sure if I have depression or any other sort of thing with me, maybe I'm just in a really bad funk. I'm too much of a coward to talk to the councilors at school so here I am. I'm a 14-year-old in school but I just feel like absolutely crap. I think it's a mixture of loneliness, self hatred, and a horrible sleep schedule. I feel lonely because of a lack of a romantical partner and because my parents don't let me hang out with my friends after school; they think most people only want to take advantage of me and that even my friends want to use me and hide their true colors. Because of this, I end up missing out on a ton of memories that my friends get to make with each other and I feel like I'm waisting my childhood being cooped up in my house. As for a romantical partner, my parents don't let me date and I want to be able to actually spend time with my significant other outside of school and give them the attention they deserve. I think that's the right choice. I honestly hate myself because two things, my addiction to ""cranking that soulja boy"" and because I'm not training as much as I used to. I think the reason why I ""honk the horn"" so many times is because it ised to distract me from how lonely I felt, now I barely get pleasure out of it. Training is an important thing for me, it's a way of life. I have an image I need to keep up at school and it pains myself to see how much I dropped since I've been feeling bad. Sleep schedule? I just need to put my phone away, but I just kinda feel drained in general. Another thing that I want to add is that sometimes I wonder how people would react if I were to kill myself, would they cry, would my family let my friends come to my funeral? I also, on rare occasions, think about self harming. I know it's horrible, but the thought comes to my head because I think that sometimes I don't deserve to feel good. Sometimes, I think I deserve pain. I'm also starting to feel more empty and I feel a lot more annoyed with my family.

Everything is my fault and I know it. 25m, I'm choosing to do this in July so that my brother can get married with his best man, that's the only reason I'm not wrapped around a tree right now and unfortunately stuck here typing. 

Essentially, I was born with anger problems and ADD which I know is not the end of the world. However each and everytime I get something to go my way I'll end up self destructing and getting angry over something usually way too small to lose any sort of opportunity for. I have lost jobs, homes, friends, girlfriends all because I couldn't stop myself from getting mad. I hate myself for it and the hatred grows towards myself with each passing moment, each letter I type, each breath I take, I know is wasted. I've never been worth anything and I know for a fact that I never will be. 

I've yelled at my parents before, made them cry, made them feel empty inside, made them feel every emotion out there and limit their happiness because I don't know how to be happy. I've tried everything, I've been through therapy both in school since grade 5 and outside of school. Talking about problems does not help me, I've had multiple occasions with my old therapist where it seemed like she was expecting me to have some sort of revelation when she told me that a lot of my anger comes from myself not feeling fufilled. I told her I never have been fulfilled by anything that I've ever done. I've talked to just regular people and professionals about it. Nothing. Ever. Helps. I've tried explaining to my parents why I feel what I feel but I cant put it into words very well without seeing them cry.

Another reason my mind is made up is because 5 years ago I made probably the stupidest mistake ever, I got drunk, again, couldn't control myself and punched a window, I have such severe damage to my hand that it has hindered me from getting a job, keeping certain jobs, working out certain ways, hell I'm using mostly my one hand to type this anyway. The injury has left me a useless one handed angry freak that cant control himself. I've tried 4 different medications in the past and not a single one has made a positive impact on my life.

If anyone I know ever sees this just make sure you know that there was nothing you could do, I tried my best to hide it from every one and it definitely was not anyone's fault but mine. Not my mom and dad, my siblings or my friends, it is solely my fault.

depression,Suicidal at 16,"I’ve been through a lot in my life and have recently moved (8 months ago) to Southern California with my aunt to become happier, because growing up in an area with constant drug abuse surrounding me, which even got to my parents putting me in foster care, and depression everywhere starts to rub off on you. But through the place where I grew up I met a girl who was the love of my life. Over a year ago we met each other but she lived far and went to a school quite far away from mine, we talked every single day and found the love we have always needed. I made the decision to move after finding out my mother overdosed on fentanyl and permanently paralyzed herself, I was told this from the aunt I lived with at that moment, and it was the first thing i’ve heard about my mother since she ghosted me which i’d say is about 4 months at that time. But with the decision of moving to the other side of California I left my girlfriend alone and she also wanted me to go find happiness and we just stayed long distance as time went on. Recently she has chosen to leave me and recommended we see other people. I’ve always battled with depression and low self esteem even while we were together, and this mindset I have has caused the girl i’ve been searching for to leave me. She says we’ll never be together and wants me to start loving myself before loving anybody else. I’ve always thought of suicide to end the constant cycle of pain and this overwhelming feeling i’ve had since I got taken from my mother, but i’ve always been too scared to go through with it and I had a girlfriend to worry about so I never could actually do it. But with no girlfriend, parents, friends, or anybody to care about there’s nothing for me to lose. I want to silence the thoughts and voices after the end of my junior year. I’ve left a lot out of my story but the feeling that my parents chose a high over a son is the most painful thing i’ve experienced as well as losing my girlfriend of a year to my depressed insecurities.

Long story short because Im just emotionally exhausted but i lost a few friendships recently over a university project. They believed i was purposefully trying to upset them by including certain videos in our video project (music video we all filmed together and they **told me the scenes were okay** etc). It was just majorly triggering for me, feeling abandoned, rejected, seen as a bad person for trying to communicate etc.. just overall being gaslit/ dumped by people.

Its like bringing up so many thoughts about my ex boyfriend for whatever reason. Like the feeling of rejection I guess. But like rn ive just fallen into a deep depression. Ive made some journalling points about things i want to do to feel better but like I just feel stuck and almost not able to do anything. Im barely even talking to anyone. And like just constantly thinking of my ex **not by choice**. Just like a hatred and terrible feeling bubbling away at me because it was my first love.

depression,Treatment Resistant Depression: What do you do when you've tried everything?,"My husband suffers from extremely severe depression. His specific diagnoses from his psychological evaluation are Persistent Depressive Disorder (Severe) with Major Depressive Episodes and psychotic features, Personality Disorder (Mixed features - specifically depressive personality), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

He's been depressed his entire life, but his coping mechanisms ran out in 2019 and he hit bottom. He has been unable to work and can barely leave the house due to agoraphobia. He's taken pretty much every single combination of medications (even the brand new Auvelity), anti-depressants with modifiers, etc. Currently he takes 2 medications to sleep because of nightmares (trazodone and prazosin) 2 medications for anxiety (propranalol and hydroxyzine), and 3 medications for antidepressant (lithium, nortriptyline, and abilify). I have to keep his medication for fear that he gets into a dissociative state and would take his life with them.

He's done a full course for DBT and currently gets individual CBT twice per week. He uses DBT skills like opposite action every day and often he can tell when he's having illogical thinking but is unable to break the feeling.

He's had about 45 sessions of ECT and while they made the tiniest bit of difference in SI, they haven't had much of a substantial impact and he still lives in a constant state of depression and frequent episodes of SI daily. He's due to start Ketamine infusions on Friday and I'm hopeful, but also fearful if it doesn't work. He has a very respected and well known doctor who specializes in TRD and ECT and even he says he's out of ideas. He said we could try TMS but he doesn't expect it to be effective.

Is there anyone else out there like him where nothing works? Anyone who has had something that has helped? We are so desperate. I've researched and researched and can't seem to come up with anything else. At this point he's not even looking for remission, just some small amount of relief and the ability to feel normal. Not even happy, just not utterly depressed.

my car is totaled and I was taken to the er and got my entire right eyebrow and up to my hair stitched up meaning I will likely not have an eyebrow. it’s been covered in dry blood so I have no idea what my eyebrow actually looks like. Yes I could be so much more hurt and I have not seen what my car looks like and I won’t see a picture of it because I have no recollection of the crash happening and I do not want to see it at all. 

I have no job and no money as I have been traveling the past few months, living such an amazing life. I came home just to work and save money but now with my eyebrow I will likely be too ugly to get a job and remote jobs have been a struggle for me to find.

depression,"Please, just one advice, please!!?","Hello to everyone!



What's the purpose of living such kind of life? I really want to know for what reason I'm here in this world.

So, first of all, I was born with cleft lip, my whole face is fckd up, I could never excepted myself, when I look into the mirror, it's just not me, I think that I'm like a car with a failure direct from the assembly line, but since we are humans, we don't go into the car crusher. I excepted that I won't be married, it's not a problem, for the women, the look is really important, and honestly, maybe I would also ignore the men like me, it's totally fair. I was always anxious, at the job I'm always introverted. However, my life was really fucked up in the last 5-6 years, I was fired, depressed etc. I went to a psychotherapy, but at the 5ht or 6th appointment, she said that she could not help me, because I always had some argument when she said something what should I do, and also said that nobody can help me, so I quit with psychotherapy. A few years ago I went again into school, to be a web developer, I graduated from the school, but after that, on my second day when I woke up to go to work, I was just mentally and physically crashed, and I could't go to work, my mind was broken or just socially I had so much fear, so I said to the boss that I'm sorry, but it's no gonna work and I took a 4-5 month break. After that I finally landed in a pretty good company, it was all good, I still had anxiety, but what could've I done? Nothing, just keep going forward. Here is another grotesk thing. I have a pretty rare illness, so, because at the work I'm constantly nervous and filled with anxiety among the people, I have a very bad body odor. It's not like I sweat a lot, it's just maybe a drop sweat, but it has an intensive odor, I also noticed that people talked about me etc. In the last half of year, the company didn't get a new projects, so I was fired, and it makes me crazy because in the decision the body odor maybe played also role. So here I'm again, without a job, probably I'm not getting again a chance as a developer, I'm alone, I really don't see a meaningful future. No job, no wife, I think the only reason I didn't kill myself are my parents. I don't want them to be filled with guilty in their entire life, but in the same time, my biggest fear is that I'll be really alone if my parents are gone, I really don't have anybody else, only a 2 friends with whom I phone a couple of times a week. I really try to be positive, but without a purpose, I can't live long, and I see myself day to day getting more depressed and more anxious. There is no light that should be me driving on the path, I think the light never existed for me, I'm like a car waiting to be crushed. Everything pushes me to point of suicide, but really everything, it's like crawling, climbing the biggest mountains, and than fall down deeper and deeper. I thought about trying out the LSD, but read that it could be worse... anyway, I felt down so deep, that I even don't want to come out. There is nothing to live for, just waste of time. No more option. Sad life right?

So I'm not sure how american system of highschool works exactly but in my country grades are divided by numbers 1-4 and I'll refer to it as such and I will write evrything in chronological order so it is understandable. I'll also change the names in case anyone finds this for my own good.


Little backroud first however I was diagnosed in the first grade of highschool but I had symptoms of depression that I kind of kept ""under control"" for atleast two years before and anxiety atleast from the 3rd grade.


Now I'll start with my rant of sorts.

1st year if highschool:
In the years before I had a friendgroup with which I wasn't really close. So becuase of my stupidity I decided to stop talking to them. And I started highschool all alone with barely anyone I know (I knew some people by name since we went to the same school but not the same class this will be important later) 


And so on my first day I sat alone and then a girl approached me and asked me if she could sit next to me, her name is Sophia and for the first two weeks we didn't talk, but then she saw me play a mobile game she also played and in very very short amount of time we became very very close.


We messaged eachother each day every day, which at first I did not mind becuase I wanted tobe there for her, she met a guy online he was from abroad and she liked him but didn't know what to do so I tried my best to support her. I don't know how good I was or how bad I was at it but at the time she seemed thankful. But soon enough it took a toll on me.


And then december came, I hit my all time low, us two had a fight over something very stupid I can't even remember the exact reason (but it was something she laughed off later so I don't think it was serious) but it took me over the edge and I started self harming. I'm not saying she was the reason it happened that would not he correct at all  that thing was just something that pushed me over the edge and I couldn't take it anymore. And that continued on for two months...
 

Until one day after my dad drove me to school that I got a panic attack becuase of an exam I didn't prepare for and I ran aeay from school, and told my mom everything. And I fell into a deep depression, I barely showered or left the bed for first few weeks. My mom was supportive and is still to this day one of my biggest supporters. 


And since healthcare in my country is bad I had to wait almost 2 months for a therapy appointment in which I was given SSRI medication ehich at first helped a lot. And after 2.5 months I returned to school, however I didn't recieve a single message from Sophia just asking about my wellbeing which I didn't mind at the time until when I returned and she was mad at me for leaving her all alone and not texting her, in the meantime she became friends with another girl who I knew from middle school(just by name) called Adella. Which was fine by me, I told her what had happened in the meantime with me and she was kind of supportive still mad but supportive in a way, but after this my mental health never became as good as it was.


And that is when the problem arrived after the incident I started becoming absent more frequently becuase now I got easily overwhelmed and since attendance is just a pretty number in my country I got by passing the first grade if highscholl with what would be an equivalent of a B.


Now we didn't text much after that mostly about school. And so this is where it all starts to go downhill.


Second grade of highschool:
Well this was the time where I felt the worst. At tbe start of the year an old friend transffered schools her name is Cindy and with her our friend group got another member a girl called Selena. I finally thought I had real friends, if only that were true. 


During the entire second grade Sophia blamed me for being apsent and for leaving her all alone, telling me my therapist was useless and that my problems were caused becuase I make myself a victim. And the other girls in the friendgroup supported her, calling it a joke. Now I don't know if it was a joke or not but I felt so bad during that time. But they were still my friends and I wanted to have someone even thought I found talking to people tiring. Also important to note I very often used to reject Sophia when she asked me to go hang out with them becuase it was a mix of depression and a mix of my parents not having money to give me to go sometimes. Which in my country is normal at the end of the month a lot of people don't go out due to lack of funds. 


But this bothered her very much becuase I didn't try for our friendship which I didn't understand, becuase hobestly I started ressenting her at that time.


Third grade this is now:
Cindy and I became very good friends, and well she apologized for everything which I wad fine with. And we started texting every day and we still do but honestly it is tiring me out. But I'll explain the rest. So I resented Sophia right. I'm sure she hated me by now also becuase she used every change she got to attack me asking me ""how I will fare in the real world?"" And claiming my therapist was useless. Mind you I was still absent a lot during those two years I'm talking around 40%-45% absence.


 I do get for some things she had a point, but my therapist was great before she retired she heloed me a lot. Now for the next part me and Sophia had a huge fight few months back becuase I couldn't take it anymore. 


And next thing I don't regret but I know was bad. I talked behind Sophia's back with Cindy. I'm not proud of it but I said what I thought of her and I still think those things (I didn't make things up just my experience and the worst thing I called her was two faced and I was glad she failed her exam, I know it is bad) now what happened was, that Cindy started to be really sad she started crying every day and she told me things she'd never tell anyone she has tons of family issues and I was a shoulder to cry on. Which again I don't mind but it is very energy consuming for me.


What happened next this is few days ago was that Adella somehow had Cindy's instagram password, and well she screnshot everything and send it to other girls. And our friendgroup disbanded when they confronted Cindy about it. And Sophia told Cindy to tell me to send her a text. I didn't want to but Cindy begged me becuase she wants to have a normal school year (it's a year until we graduate now). And so I did. And this is how it went in rough lines:


I asked if she wanted to talk
She asked me if I had a problem with her
I said I did and asked if that was surprising after everything
Now here we told eachother many things and it was mostly about me not being sorry about things and standing behind what I said and her calling me a coward for nit telling it toher face, which I do get and telling me that she still thought of us as friends and that I'm acting surperior becuase apparently I finally had balls to not apologize(those were her words)
And then at the ends she sent me a message saying that she was still open to being friends and that if I ever wanted to we can talk again about it and that she can get over me talking behind her back
To that I told her I wasn't interested


And now, present day, I'm kind of alone, Cindy apologized but she still talks to me, I didn't go to school for past few days becuase I feel so shitty tommorow I have to go becuase I have to write some tests but I just, don't even know what to thing anymore. I have thousand questions going on inside my head. Am I a bad person in this story? Was I a terrible friend? Do I even deserve to have friends after this?


I know talking behind someone's back is bad, but I don't even know why I did it, I just had a need for it then. I wouldn't repeat it again but it still feels shitty. I don't want to be friends with her again, but it still left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I don't know what to do and I wish someone gave me their opinion. Sorry for writing so much I got carried away.

 I honestly feel like I am in a twilight zone episode half of the time now, because despite outwardly giving people reasons to like me, I have not had a single person express feelings other than acquaintance towards me.

 It kind of feels dystopia having to exist in the same timeline, where people are so scared of dating, dinner is considered sketchy. Even after hitting it off in the DMs.

 My friends kind of forget about me other than 3 that are 300 miles away. I moved way out here for opportunities in my hobbies, and I feel more alone than not having anything in common with the people I was originally surrounded by.

 I still have yet to go on my first date and my 21st birthday is heading near. I would love to think that people won't just pick to date me once I'm finally old enough to buy alcohol, but it seems like that is where it is headed. It would be really cool if the texting goes good for a day or two, and then we meet in a public place and just enjoy some food. I am clearly asking for too much

 I don't generally make people uncomfortable. When I went on vacation, a good number of my coworkers told me that they missed me. I missed them too. But I need something more than just coworkers right now. I genuinely feel like my wants and cravings are getting in the way of me being happy, but I have tried no focusing on those things.

I don’t want to take medication but the outbursts and irritation has been getting worse and worse. I never feel “suicidal”. Sometimes I do want to die but I never want to harm myself. I usually say I just want to “disappear” or “go away”. I try to keep myself busy because I’ve noticed that once I get bored and allow myself to just sit with my thoughts, thats when I start to spiral. I also have really bad eating habits (which I also tend to beat myself up about) and body image issues. On top of that I’ve set really high expectations for myself (education & image-wise). When I tell my friends how I’m feeling, I usually end up deleting what I said or leave the gc out of impulsiveness because I feel like a burden. I feel like all of these things pour into my “episodes”. And I’m not entirely sure what to do. Ik the next time I go to therapy (Tmr) we’ll start working on way to overcome all of this but I’m feeling a little hopeless.

Objectively I know this is bad and that I shouldn't want this. I know that the people who have gone through these things wish they hadn't but I can't stop. What's wrong with me?,0.089,0.247,0.664
